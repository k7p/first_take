Does Kyrie have a legitimate excuse for missing Game 7? Why are so many players taking shots at the Patriots for having ""no fun?"" @undisputed. FS1."
1001453473030750208,2018-05-29 13:21:28,Will this Finals help or hurt LeBron's case against Michael Jordan? @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1
1001310406520913920,2018-05-29 03:52:59,Rockets went 1-21 from 3 in the second half??? That's home Game 7 pressure wrapped around the throats of a team there for the first time.
1001305050768015360,2018-05-29 03:31:42,"Sorry about that, LeBron. Too bad about being 3-6 in NBA Finals. You'll have as many losses as MJ had wins without a loss."
1001304623968276481,2018-05-29 03:30:00,"Kevin Durant went from playing 2 1/2 awful games ... to looking like The Best Player on the Planet in the second half of this Game 7. Way to go, KD. Can't wait to see LeShannon Sharpe's face at 9:30 E on FS1. Warriors are about to be UNDISPUTED again."
1001303730971525121,2018-05-29 03:26:27,Harden 2-13 from 3. Gordon 2-12. Ariza 0-9. That's 30 missed threes. That's how you blow a home Game 7.
1001302739836551170,2018-05-29 03:22:31,James Harden is made only for the regular season.
1001298577136668673,2018-05-29 03:05:58,The Rockets in total missed 27 threes in a row before PJTucker finally made that one??? It's really a shame they're having to play this Game 7 without CP3 on the floor.
1001297950897684480,2018-05-29 03:03:29,The Rockets have now missed a playoff record 25 straight threes??? Home Game 7s will do that to you. See Celtics.
1001297588828557313,2018-05-29 03:02:03,"Finally, KD is turning back into KD."
1001294731597438981,2018-05-29 02:50:41,"UNBELIEVABLE. I didn't think the Rockets would allow the Warriors to third-quarter them AGAIN. Golden State 33, Houston 15 in that quarter. Got Stephed AGAIN. You there James?"
1001284842955227136,2018-05-29 02:11:24,"Only hope the Warriors have now is if Harden reverts to ""Playoff James."""
1001284259187863553,2018-05-29 02:09:05,"I can't imagine the Warriors playing a worse first half, especially in a Game 7. Just hard to watch. LeBron has to be cheering like crazy for the Rockets."
1001281026109329409,2018-05-29 01:56:14,Kevin Durant is playing like a man who got his ring and his Finals MVP and his validation and vindication for leaving Westbrook ... like last season was all he really wanted or needed.
1001277827340165121,2018-05-29 01:43:31,"Houston just wants this game a whole lot more than Golden State. Warriors just look like they've run out of mental gas. ADVANTAGE, LEBRON."
1001277015134093312,2018-05-29 01:40:17,Draymond is almost as big a mess right now as KD.
1001276468326887424,2018-05-29 01:38:07,"Kevin Durant has lost his confidence, his flow, his fire. That's the biggest reason the Warriors are in danger of losing this game."
1001270641159426048,2018-05-29 01:14:58,"What a terrible start for Golden State: 2 quick turnovers and now three fouls on the Warrior who was most valuable on offense and defense on Saturday night, Klay Thompson. Now no Klay or Iggy to guard JHarden."
1001268205933903872,2018-05-29 01:05:17,LeBron has had several better big games than last night's.
1001267611944927232,2018-05-29 01:02:55,Amusing to me that Ty Lue called last night LeBron's greatest game. The too-green Celts missed 32 threes! LeBron was his usual dominant self vs a team with no one who can defend him. But he had eight turnovers and now leads the playoffs in turnovers by 14!
1001267070300971008,2018-05-29 01:00:46,LeBron got one big break in the East when Boston upset Philly. He would get another big one tonight if the Rockets upset the Warriors.
1001266713701171200,2018-05-29 00:59:21,"God bless all those who have served or are serving or defending the greatest country in the world. This day is for you, and we thank you."

1001092302088028163,2018-05-28 13:26:18,Also today: Was last night LeBron's greatest game? Is reaching the NBA Finals with this Cavs team LeBron's greatest achievement? How impressive are LeBron's 8 straight Eastern Conference titles? How impressive was LeBron's block? Who wins Game 7 tonight?
1001091050016948224,2018-05-28 13:21:20,Does that close the case: LeBron is better than Jordan? We debate. @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1
1000938833842589701,2018-05-28 03:16:29,LeBron James sure did have a lot of help tonight.
1000938033133207552,2018-05-28 03:13:18,"This is smart: LeBron is crediting his teammates while all the ESPN questions are about how carrying this (sorry) team to the Finals is ""the greatest achievement ever."""
1000937665514979328,2018-05-28 03:11:50,"This is funny: LeBron is now lying on the floor during the championship presentation, sending the message to Blind Witnesses he carried a heavy load the whole game and throughout the playoffs."
1000937257673478144,2018-05-28 03:10:13,I'm a Kyrie fan but (unless he had a legit excuse) I'm very disappointed he wasn't at the game tonight. The Celtics could've at least used his presence on the bench and in the huddle.
1000936776091881472,2018-05-28 03:08:18,"Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart combined to go 3-26 from 3. Most of 'em were WIDE OPEN. This stage was just too big for these Celtics, as I predicted it would be."
1000935856868241409,2018-05-28 03:04:39,"I predicted 39/15/12 for LeBron. He had 35/15/9. LeShannon Sharpe bet me a case of Diet Dew that LeBron would score 50+ tonight. I win again. I CAN'T WAIT FOR TOMORROW'S UNDISPUTEDL 9:30-NOON E, FS1. I sure hope Shannon wears his goat mask."
1000934713479938048,2018-05-28 03:00:06,It's laughable to think winning the Least with this team was some great achievement by LeBron. Victor Oladipo's Indiana? The same sorry Raptors they swept LAST YEAR? The overachieving Celtics without two All-Stars??? Huh? LeBron's Cavs SHOULD'VE won the Least.
1000934087291420672,2018-05-28 02:57:37,Boston just massacred itself.
1000933985428516864,2018-05-28 02:57:13,The Cavs have finally done what they should've done in five games. They're just better than Boston. They have LeBron James. The Celtics didn't have Kyrie or Hayward. Shame it took so long.
1000933361479663616,2018-05-28 02:54:44,Terry Rozier has been shockingly Scary for Celtics fans. He has simply shot his team right out of this game.
1000932474287894528,2018-05-28 02:51:12,"DRIVE IT, LEBRON."
1000932103767318529,2018-05-28 02:49:44,That was not a foul.
1000930437747769344,2018-05-28 02:43:07,"JUST ATTACK, LEBRON."
1000929430804484096,2018-05-28 02:39:07,LeBron just got posterized by Jayson Tatum.
1000929227158446080,2018-05-28 02:38:18,Poor Jayson Tatum just doesn't have enough help. Rozier and Jaylen Brown are a combined 2-18 from 3.
1000928675150290945,2018-05-28 02:36:07,"AGAIN: NO CELTIC CAN KEEP LEBRON FROM THE RIM OR THE FREE-THROW LINE. THIS GAME IS ON A SILVER PLATTER FOR HIM. Home, James."
1000926906827522048,2018-05-28 02:29:05,The Celtics are just pitiful offensively. Hard to fathom how they're still in this game.
1000925659835785216,2018-05-28 02:24:08,"Come on, King, put this thing away."
1000925480881602562,2018-05-28 02:23:25,"The Boston Celtics in a home Game 7 are 4-26 from 3 through 3 quarters. That's 15%. Somewhere, Larry Bird is shaking his head and mumbling something unprintable."
1000922844241391616,2018-05-28 02:12:56,"Hustle, LeBron, it isn't over yet ... but it's close to being."
1000922348172660736,2018-05-28 02:10:58,"I'm sorry, I can't get excited about 6-9 LeBron blocking 6-1 Rozier who can't buy a basket and WHO GOT FOULED BY LEBRON ON THE HAND ANY WAY."
1000920752047120385,2018-05-28 02:04:38,"REMINDER: Shannon Sharpe and I will be live as always tomorrow morning for a holiday Undisputed, 9:30-noon E on FS1. JOIN US FOR A LEBRONATHON."
1000919077748011008,2018-05-28 01:57:58,We've seen enough brick-laying so far by both teams to build a new Garden.
1000918359926423552,2018-05-28 01:55:07,"Now the pressure will start getting to the Celtics, who know they're not supposed to be here and have never been under this kind of one-game-away-from-the-Finals heat."
1000915711357669376,2018-05-28 01:44:36,"Five more turnovers in the first half, LeBron??? Come on, King, you're better than that."
1000915483107901440,2018-05-28 01:43:41,Rookie Jayson Tatum needs a lot more help.
1000915091187843072,2018-05-28 01:42:08,"LeBron basically played 1-man zone defense again, standing under the basket. Hence, 10 rebounds. His man hit some open shots, missed several more. Celts shot only 38.6 %. THEY'RE A BELOW-AVERAGE OFFENSIVE TEAM WITHOUT KYRIE."
1000914041714307074,2018-05-28 01:37:58,Great flop by Marcus Smart.
1000908178526121984,2018-05-28 01:14:40,Nance's 3rd foul is trouble for the Cavs.
1000904511408369664,2018-05-28 01:00:06,Again: the Celtics have NOBODY who can keep LeBron from the rim or the free-throw line.
1000896588636602368,2018-05-28 00:28:37,"Tonight, the Celts will miss Kyrie. They've overachieved sensationally to this point. But in Game 7 vs the King, they wake up and turn back into pumpkins."
1000896158900748288,2018-05-28 00:26:54,"After Kevin Love was lost early in Game 6, I was pleasantly surprised by the energy Larry Nance Jr. provided. His young legs and hustle on both ends are just what the Cavs will need tonight against the high-energy scratch-and-claw Celts. Tonight, the Cavs won't miss Love."
1000895079643426818,2018-05-28 00:22:37,"LeBron OWES his team for his bizarre LeTired night in Game 5. And I believe he will pay his team back with a big game tonight: 39/15/12. Cavs by 10, 105-95."
1000578786520268800,2018-05-27 03:25:47,"Harden turned back into ""Playoff James"" ... ""Way Off"" James ... in the 2nd half as the Houston Rockets managed all of TWENTY-FIVE points."
1000576525220036608,2018-05-27 03:16:48,"Now we see who can get/stay healthy for Game 7: CP3 or Iggy or neither or both. If both play, and play effectively, I still like Golden State. If only CP3 can go ..."
1000575590582312962,2018-05-27 03:13:05,"Klay Thompson saved the Warriors' season. Great to see because he's the most likable Warrior. He has sacrificed the most, maintained humility. But when he's needed, he's every bit the shooter Steph is."
1000563129082724353,2018-05-27 02:23:34,Draymond is playing almost as stunningly poorly as Durant. But so far Klay has saved them.
1000560827114573824,2018-05-27 02:14:25,James Harden should be much better under mounting 2nd-half pressure that usually derails him because he's working with a home Game 7 safety net.
1000560171716788224,2018-05-27 02:11:49,"Kevin Durant looks distracted. Off-court drama? Too many Silicon Valley investments to keep up with? Not as hungry after he won his ring and Finals MVP? I don't know, but something is not right."
1000559454788579334,2018-05-27 02:08:58,"KD: 3-11 from floor. Steph: 1-7 from 3. Rockets: plus 21 from 3, outshooting the Warriors 11-4 from 3. Rockets, playing harder and smarter. Steve Kerr, too nice and supportive to light the angry halftime fire this team now desperately needs."
1000551823223111680,2018-05-27 01:38:38,I still expect one big Steph-fueled run from the Warriors.
1000551102482284544,2018-05-27 01:35:46,"Golden State of shock. Rockets are just firing at will from 3, with nothing to lose but going home for Game 7, while the Warriors are playing tighter and tighter as do turns into die."
1000550679306428416,2018-05-27 01:34:05,"Kevin Durant, reigning Finals MVP, former MVP, 4-time NBA scoring champ, has turned into a no-confidence mess, thanks mostly to the savvy and physicality of PJ Tucker."
1000543148068622336,2018-05-27 01:04:10,What a low-pressure opportunity this is for James Harden to redeem his postseason legacy.
1000436531666960385,2018-05-26 18:00:31,The Celtics have sensationally overachieved to get this far. Hope they enjoyed it while it lasted.
1000436211859701761,2018-05-26 17:59:14,The Boston Celtics are really going to miss Kyrie tomorrow night.
1000435667896221696,2018-05-26 17:57:05,"The best game I ever saw LeBron James play was Game 6 of the East finals in 2012. Extreme pressure, elimination game ... in the same arena he'll play Game 7 in tomorrow night. He's had many explosive nights in this building. Does not bode well for the Celtics. Good luck, Green."
1000210409868017665,2018-05-26 03:01:59,LeBron finishes with 46/11/9. I predicted 44/12/10. JOIN ME ON FACEBOOK IN COUPLE OF MINUTES.
1000204442694660096,2018-05-26 02:38:16,How many LeBron misses at the rim have been followed by him or teammates? Those second-chance points are the difference in the game right now.
1000204019480936448,2018-05-26 02:36:35,I WILL GO LIVE ON FACEBOOK SOON AFTER THIS GAME ENDS. JOIN ME.
1000203361528905728,2018-05-26 02:33:58,"What?! 6-4 Marcus Smart just rejected a 6-9 LeBron dunk attempt at the rim?! How embarrassing for a player who's ""better than Michael Jordan."""
1000202018227539968,2018-05-26 02:28:38,Whether Kevin Love will be cleared to play Sunday's Game 7 will be a  big deal. Not obviously CP3 big but Love was leading the NBA playoffs in rebounds.
1000198131168899073,2018-05-26 02:13:11,The Celtics did not believe they would win in the King's house tonight and I don't believe they believe they can beat LeBron in a Game 7 in Boston.
1000192575268044801,2018-05-26 01:51:07,"The Cavs just did in the 2nd quarter what I thought they'd do in the 1st: They won the 2nd 34-18! Made the Celts look ordinary on offense, which they are. The King should get some 4th-quarter rest ahead of Game 7."
1000190717480787969,2018-05-26 01:43:44,"Dominant 1st half by LeBron, who did exactly what he needed to do. Played all 24 minutes. Only 1 turnover. Locked in. Attacking. Shooting it with conviction and smooth confidence. He has taken care of business."
1000187034638499840,2018-05-26 01:29:06,"FYI, Jayson Tatum did stay in the game after he hit heads with Kevin Love. But he sure has been quiet since. Maybe he's feeling the effects, too."
1000186135178395649,2018-05-26 01:25:31,Bring on Game 7.
1000184989877600257,2018-05-26 01:20:58,"Man, LeBron is getting a shocking amount of help from Korver, Jeff Green, Nance Jr and Clarkson. Who knew any of these guys could play a lick? Thought the King would have to do this by himself."
1000181586871042048,2018-05-26 01:07:27,"As usual, LeBron can score at the rim just about any time he wants. But the Celts were getting just about anything they wanted on offense, too. I thought the Cavs would home-court blitz them in the 1st quarter. Nope. Boston, 25-20."
1000178729719549953,2018-05-26 00:56:06,"Obviously if Kevin Love is diagnosed with a concussion, that will be a huge loss for the Cavs. He's an All-Star who has played in lots of high-stakes playoff games."
1000172864455168000,2018-05-26 00:32:47,No more LeTired for the rest of these playoffs. He's greater than that.
1000172199100076032,2018-05-26 00:30:09,I got LeBron big tonight. Re-imposes his will on Kyrie-less Celts. 44/12/10. Cavs 115-90. This is just a formality before Sunday's Game 7 back in Boston. But I do hope the King got a long nap today and drank plenty of fluids. #StriveForGreatness

999863559831011328,2018-05-25 04:03:43,Obviously the huge wide-open shot poor Quinn Cook was forced to take (because CP3 had pulled his hamstring at the other end) would usually have been taken by the injured Andre Iguodala.
999859815328268288,2018-05-25 03:48:51,"After winning 10 straight cases of Diet Mt Dew from my man Shannon Sharpe, I've now lost 2 straight. Not looking forward to tomorrow's Undisputed, 9:30 E, FS1. Hey, King, you might not have to deal with Golden State after all. ANOTHER huge break."
999857931066593281,2018-05-25 03:41:21,"I've said since last year's Finals, when Kevin Durant won MVP,  that HE'S The Best Player on the Planet. No more. Not after the last two games, when he got roughed up and intimidated and ran from the ball late tonight. Extremely disappointed in him ... as I am in LeTired."
999857084035289088,2018-05-25 03:37:59,Now we await news on Chris Paul's pulled hamstring. He once eliminated my Spurs on a pulled hamstring.

999855812393582592,2018-05-25 03:32:56,"What an abomination of a finish and game for the reigning champs. They someone had 3 shocking opportunities to win and take command. Quinn Cook, wide-open miss. Steph, tough close miss. Draymond unforced embarrassment of a butter-fingered turnover."
999848503089090562,2018-05-25 03:03:54,Kevin Durant is just stinking this up. Warriors are hanging in in spite of him.
999846513697214464,2018-05-25 02:55:59,Chris Paul is out of his mind. Never seen him like this with the stakes this high.
999846023190081542,2018-05-25 02:54:02,"No way the Warriors can overcome Houston's crowd, defense and CP3 shot-making in this 4th quarter."

999483038500204546,2018-05-24 02:51:40,What is LeBron DOING???
999482337187454976,2018-05-24 02:48:53,"OK, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS FROM HERE ON, I'M GOING LIVE ON FACEBOOK JUST AFTER THIS GAME ENDS TO GIVE MY IMMEDIATE GUT REACTION AHEAD OF TOMORROW'S UNDISPUTED. JOIN ME."
999481814380040192,2018-05-24 02:46:48,"TAKE IT TO THE BASKET, LEBRON. THEY CAN'T SCORE."
999481215492108289,2018-05-24 02:44:25,This is where the Celts miss Kyrie. No closer.
999480646576697349,2018-05-24 02:42:10,"This game is sitting on a silver platter for the King, if he can reach down for the energy."
999480212529152001,2018-05-24 02:40:26,"Remember, the Celts struggled like crazy to close out Game 2 at home. Just couldn't buy a basket for 7 straight 4th-quarter minutes."
999479379129331717,2018-05-24 02:37:08,Warriors were up 12 at this point at home last night.
999478553828737025,2018-05-24 02:33:51,"Yes, the Cavs' starting backcourt, JR and GHill, are just 2-10. BUT ... the Celts starting backcourt, JBrown and Rozier, are 4-20."
999475484747427840,2018-05-24 02:21:39,I have to believe LeBron is saving himself for a huge 4th-quarter run that would just rip the basketball hearts out of the Celtics and their fans.
999472189324771328,2018-05-24 02:08:33,"When LeBron throws up a LEFT-HANDED air ball in the lane, it sends the wrong message to his teammates: ""I'm not taking this that seriously."" He can score at will at the rim on this team. Lock in, King."
999468436731215873,2018-05-24 01:53:39,First half was pretty simple: Celts just wanted it more than the Cavs.
999467487459622912,2018-05-24 01:49:52,LeBron's Team didn't play with near the energy and urgency on defense they did at home. This looks like the team that finished 29th of 30 teams in defense. Way too easy for a Celts team that ranked 18th on offense.
999467124698435586,2018-05-24 01:48:26,LeBron can score at the rim on the Celtics any time he wants ... if he doesn't run out of gas. Sixers would've been a different story with Embiid and Simmons patrolling the paint. But LeBron can take over this game whenever he wants.
999466297615306752,2018-05-24 01:45:09,LeBron is tired AGAIN??? Has looked a little lethargic all night. Isn't he supposed to be the world's finest conditioned athlete? MJ never got tired. MJ played all 82 nine times. This was the first year LeBron played all 82. Is he sick? Hurt? I just don't get it.
999460226859347968,2018-05-24 01:21:01,"No 1, Marcus Morris fouled Nance in breaking up the pass. No. 2 Morris blatantly taunted him. Yet the Celts get TWO techs for retaliation? Not right."
999447953310867458,2018-05-24 00:32:15,"Cavs 102, Celtics 96."
999447650641502208,2018-05-24 00:31:03,"Come on, King, 4 quarters of all-out on offense AND defense. Be Jordanesque. None of this, ""I'm No. 1 in the NBA in being tired after games."" Please. No cruising or resting on either end. Take care of business. Put 'em away."

999134100916072449,2018-05-23 03:45:07,"James Harden, 3-12 from 3. Eric Gordon, 1-8 from 3. And the Rpckets suffocated the Warriors in the 4th quarter, holding them to 12 points and one assist at Roaracle. Just mind-boggling."
999131524879466497,2018-05-23 03:34:53,"I just lost a ""cinch"" bet to Shannon Sharpe after winning 10 straight from him. As my wife Ernestine always reminds me, ""There's no such thing as a sure thing."" Now I'm dreading 9:30 E on FS1. Nooooooooooo!"
999130573913272320,2018-05-23 03:31:06,I can't believe 1) the Golden State Warriors wound up with nothing more than a forced-up Klay Thompson air ball to tie or win and 2) Steph Curry badly missed a wide-open 3 to tie. Just pathetic. Got physically/psychologically bullied by Houston's defense.
999128957457858560,2018-05-23 03:24:41,The Rockets are now in commanding position to achieve their ultimate goal of dethroning the Warriors. Did not see this coming. Much respect to the Rockets.
999127713850900480,2018-05-23 03:19:44,"Incredibly, the Rockets' defense has completely taken the Warriors out of everything they do on offense."
999127290226163712,2018-05-23 03:18:03,"Golden State is going to lose this game. Gave Houston its two best shots, 1st and 3rd quarter, but the Rockets wouldn't give up, wanted it more."

999123569731776512,2018-05-23 03:03:16,"If the Warriors are going to win this game, Kevin Durant is going to have to play like the reigning Finals MVP."
999123014997262337,2018-05-23 03:01:04,Draymond had better make these free throws to make up for getting his dunk blocked by the rim.
999112218368069632,2018-05-23 02:18:10,"I shouldn't have guaranteed victory over Shannon on today's Undisputed. He gave me Golden State straight up in Game 4. Jinxed myself. Of course, Shannon just doesn't want LeBron to have to face the Warriors again."
999111301568737281,2018-05-23 02:14:31,"I'm in danger of losing a rare bet to Shannon Sharpe. No Iggy. Klay gimpy. Steph, foul trouble. KD, hit &amp; miss. Dubs went into cruise control up 12-0. Now Rockets are imposing their physical will on 'em. Could lead series 2-2."

998742501992394752,2018-05-22 01:49:02,"By my count, 3 of tonight's Celtic starters (Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Terry Rozier) have a total of 229 NBA starts (regular and postseason). LeBron James has 1,374 starts. That's SiX times the starts of 3 starters combined. Mismatch."
998737226539323392,2018-05-22 01:28:05,"How good is Kyle Korver. One of the greatest shooters ever, knows how to play, gives every last ounce playing hard, smart defense. Yet doesn't even start for the Cavs. Does LeBron ever have some help."
998734300517314560,2018-05-22 01:16:27,"When LeBron actually tries to play defense, and inspires his teammates to play D, the Cavs can be a pretty tough defensive club. Tristan and Korver have been particularly impressive on that end. Korver: 2 blocks on Jaylen Brown!"

998020254251999233,2018-05-20 01:59:05,"I don't know who from the Players Association negotiated three days rest after the first two games of the conference finals, but it sure benefited LeBron James. I'm guessing he suggested or at least encouraged it."
998019617124597760,2018-05-20 01:56:33,That was one of the best all-around halves of playoff basketball I've ever seen LeBron James play.
998016228391190530,2018-05-20 01:43:05,"This one's over. I won't be shocked if the Cavs win the next three games, too. Get real: The Cavs are better than the Celtics."
998009189845745665,2018-05-20 01:15:07,"DEE-FENSE, BRON! Love it!"
998008205727838208,2018-05-20 01:11:12,"WAY TO GO, KING: LeBron set the 1st-quarter tone with his DEE-FENSE on Jaylen Brown. In Game 2, while LeBron was scoring 21 in the 1st, he didn't even try to guard JB, who scored 14. Tonight, rested LBJ took the challenge, outscored JB 12-0 in 1st."
998003050546544640,2018-05-20 00:50:43,"Jayson Tatum, just a rookie, said he watched Kobe's critique of Game 2 about 25 times. No, Jayson, he's showing you how to be Kobe, how to be a solo green-light scorer. Not who you guys are."
998000690348748807,2018-05-20 00:41:21,Kyle Korver should be starting - and for sure he should play a whole lot more than he did in Game 2.
997998710037532672,2018-05-20 00:33:29,"Dee-fense, King!"
997998453878738944,2018-05-20 00:32:27,I will go live on Facebook right after the game to unleash my immediate thoughts.
997998188400295936,2018-05-20 00:31:24,"Cavs 112, Celts 97. The Celts are NOT the better team, not without Kyrie."
997919246595244032,2018-05-19 19:17:43,"Cowboys offseason goes from bad to worse. TWil, arrested. Accused of driving drunk, crashing Lambo. Could be suspended at team's weakest position. Then again, caught 0 TDs last yr. Pick-6 drop vs GBay. Foot surgery. TWon't. Ug."
997873992949153792,2018-05-19 16:17:54,"Good for Johnny Manziel. Go to Canada, consistently show the NFL you can again be Johnny Football on the field while being grown-up, cleaned-up John off it. Long way to go but this is a start, a last start."
997585397583495170,2018-05-18 21:11:07,"When MJ was a year older than LeBron, in his final game for the Bulls, closeout G6 at Utah, he scored 45 of their 87 points and had 4 steals, including the late one from Karl Malone that led to his game-winning jumper. He made NBA 1st team all-defense that season."
997584564880007168,2018-05-18 21:07:49,"I was wrong about Cavs in 5 but I still believe they can and will win Games 3 and 4 in Cleveland. The Celtics obviously don't have Kyrie or Hayward while the Cavs have ""the best player on the planet"" who is ""better than Michael Jordan."" That should be enough."
997583582997594112,2018-05-18 21:03:55,"Key for the Cavs in Game 3: Will LeBron, after 3 days of rest, be able to consistently attack and penetrate Boston's D for 4 quarters and will he quit resting on defense? He has fallen to 74th in the playoffs in individual D. The man he's ""guarding"" has consistently hurt Cavs."
997581513041461249,2018-05-18 20:55:41,Undisputed returns Monday. I will go live on Facebook right after LeBron's game tomorrow night. See you then.

996952539546378241,2018-05-17 03:16:22,I still can't see the Rockets winning a game in Oakland.
996952324290498560,2018-05-17 03:15:31,I'll always remember this as the PJ Tucker Game. 8-9 from the field. 5-6 from 3. Career high 22 points. Physical D ... while JHarden went 3-15 from 3 with only 3 assists.
996951294358175744,2018-05-17 03:11:25,"With 8 minutes left, Iggy missed a free throw that would've cut it to 10. Now it's 26. Rockets said NO."
996950726235504640,2018-05-17 03:09:10,I know it was Draymond but that was just a common push foul. No flagrant.
996946494241390592,2018-05-17 02:52:21,"For once Steph, having to work so hard on defense, is killing the Warriors on offense."
996946172978741248,2018-05-17 02:51:04,"Houston's 3rd quarter was even more impressive than its first half. Just attacking Golden State and roughing 'em up. So far, they just WANT this game more. Tonight is their whole season. A loss would invalidate 65 wins."
996936575974977536,2018-05-17 02:12:56,"For the playoffs, LeBron now ranks 74th in individual defensive win shares. For the season, he ranked 309th. Just FYI."
996935914298359808,2018-05-17 02:10:18,Golden State's 2nd-half comeback now depends on Steph going from 0-5 from 3 to maybe 5-12 for the game. He has struggled for long stretches of past playoffs. And he has often broken out of it.
996935119771287552,2018-05-17 02:07:09,Not sure the Rockets can play much better or harder than that. 10 threes i the 1st half! BUT: Feels like the Warriors needed this down-14 challenge to get them going. Wouldn't they love to shoot Houston's lights out now.
996921084401209345,2018-05-17 01:11:23,"Remember, MJ made 1st team all-defense 12 times to LeBron's 6 and led the league in scoring 10 times to LeBron's 1. MJ played supremely hard on both ends without needing to rest the way LeBron now does on defense."
996920409223184385,2018-05-17 01:08:42,"LeBron carries the biggest offensive load ever? Uh, no. MJ led the playoffs 6 times in usage rate (time w ball in hands). LeBron has led once. At age 34, his last yr in Chi, MJ made 1st team all-defense while still leading the NBA in scoring. Yet he didn't ever get tired."
996919120133218304,2018-05-17 01:03:34,LeBron apologists: No doubt he's playing offense at the highest level of his career. BUT HOW CAN YOU GIVE HIM A PASS FOR DOING SO AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS DEFENSE? He now plays little to no D bc he rests on D. The Cavs are awful on D because their leader sets such a poor tone.
996779097291345921,2018-05-16 15:47:10,"LeBron has to be a Sixer. He gets to stay in the Leastern Conference, and they have Embiid and Simmons. More @Undisputed, now on FS1 https://t.co/NSq4ZDPZ2Z"

Ty Lue accused the CELTICS of ""gooning""? Does the Cavs No. 8 pick mean LeBron is gone? Can the Rockets win a single game against Golden State?"
996740957000187906,2018-05-16 13:15:37,Who or what is most to blame for the Cavs loss last night? @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1
996601455892094976,2018-05-16 04:01:17,"LeBron sure is happy in his post-game interview. Cracking jokes, cutting up. I guess that's how you are when you score 42 and you know your apologists will condemn your lack of help."
996592955388346368,2018-05-16 03:27:31,"I had the Cavs winning tonight 95-93. The Cavs scored 94. But they gave up 107. Yes, you're right, LeBron's Team finished 29th of 30 NBA teams in defense."
996589322303242240,2018-05-16 03:13:04,"You know who was supposed to be guarding Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier when they made wide-open threes, don't you? Yep. Him."
996588937253548032,2018-05-16 03:11:33,"What ultimately separates MJ, Kobe &amp; KD from LeBron is what no one wants to talk about: DEFENSE. LeBron barely plays any D any more. He's going to have to inspire his team on the DEFENSIVE END if Cavs are going to climb back into this series."
996588132395962368,2018-05-16 03:08:21,"LeBron just had James Harden kind of impact. Took 29 shots, 11 more than any teammate, took 11 threes, scored 42 ... lost by 13. The Blind Witnesses will blame JR Smith."
996586768701911041,2018-05-16 03:02:56,Was I ever wrong about this series. So much for my Cavs in 5.
996586443815374848,2018-05-16 03:01:38,"Incredibly, LeBron and Co. have scored only 22 in the 3rd q and 17 in the 4th. HUH?"
996585430135988224,2018-05-16 02:57:36,"Unbelievably, Al Horford is going LeBron James on the Cavs."
996583967770853376,2018-05-16 02:51:48,Good for Marcus Smart going at JR for his dirty shove of Horford. Had to be done ... without throwing a punch.
996582204112187392,2018-05-16 02:44:47,"The Celtics cannot guard LeBron James - and they can't make a shot as the pressure mounts. Take it home, King."
996580384371425280,2018-05-16 02:37:33,"Celts cannot make a shot, leaving the door open for the King."
996577353554776064,2018-05-16 02:25:31,"I am shocked by what I just Witnessed. Boston just won the 3rd quarter 36-22??? LeBron kept resting on defense, leaving Rozier open until that final drive (that almost went in). Come on, King, turn it up on both ends."
996574891070533633,2018-05-16 02:15:44,"LeBron James, still the best passer in basketball."
996574233361723392,2018-05-16 02:13:07,"Where was the chase-down from 6-9 LeBron on 6-1 Rozier??? LeBron pulled up. Didn't want to expend the energy on a defensive play??? Didn't want to get posterized by such a little guy??? Come on, Bron."
996568676957487104,2018-05-16 01:51:02,"LeBron took the heart right out of the Celts, who looked off balance and out of sync. I expect LeBron to shake off his neck strain and pour it on. Cavs got this one, back in charge of the series."
996560209383337984,2018-05-16 01:17:23,"Kyle Korver, 4th best 3-point shooter IN NBA HISTORY. Does he qualify as LeBron help?"
996558030828224513,2018-05-16 01:08:44,"LeBron came in shooting 26% from 3 through his 1st 12 playoff games. Put in work before the game, caught a hot streak. Now would still like to see his teammates start making a few, too."
996557646206353408,2018-05-16 01:07:12,"This is the LeBron I expected in Game 1. Full-on attack mode. All offense, very little defense. Now, can he sustain the energy? Celts haven't gone away yet."
996549772885413889,2018-05-16 00:35:55,These Celts were the NBA's No.-1 defensive team all season long. They're 8-0 at home in the playoffs. They have LeBron-like basketball IQ. They're mentally and physically tough. This will not be easy for the King. But I still expect the Cavs to win a close game.
996549037804290049,2018-05-16 00:33:00,"In my career, I've never seen anything quite like the pressure/expectation on LeBron building up to this Game 2. Everyone is predicting a LEGENDARY bounce-back game for him. Wonder how the Celtics feel hearing that for the last 48 hours?"
996547898614669312,2018-05-16 00:28:28,"Cavs do NOT hit the lottery as they've done before, instead landing the more predictable No. 8 pick. That's obviously no incentive for LeBron to stay. The obvious move now is to stay in the weaker East and join forces with Sixers' young stars."

996228725627744256,2018-05-15 03:20:11,Wake me up when the Rockets win a game. James Harden's incredible solo act just isn't enough to overcome Golden State's team basketball.
996228134633525249,2018-05-15 03:17:50,"One year ago today, the San Antonio Spurs led Golden State by 23 midway through the 3rd quarter of Game 1 of the West finals IN OAKLAND! Then Zaza Pacheapshot saved the Warriors' season."
996210008969789440,2018-05-15 02:05:49,"James Harden just put on a mostly indefensible first-half offensive show. Now, can he sustain this level of play for 6 or 7 games?"
996196656423911425,2018-05-15 01:12:45,What is Draymond DOING? Out of control.
996194375003660288,2018-05-15 01:03:42,"For now, I'm more interested in the solo-star Cavs vs the no-Kyrie Celts than I am in the 4-star Warriors vs the 2-star Rockets. Maybe that'll change tonight. But I doubt it."
996148196148625411,2018-05-14 22:00:12,"Kobe WAS a more skilled jumpshooter, free-throw shooter and ball-handler than LeBron. He also made 1st team all-defense 12 times to LeBron's 6. Finally, I give him the edge in killer will (Mamba Mentality). No, we haven't forgotten, Kobe."
996144764071264256,2018-05-14 21:46:33,"LeBron's ""total recall"" was actually a sanitized play by play omitting 2 details. Marcus Smart hit the 3 bc LeBron loafed on defense. Then, he said, ""We missed another shot."" Nope, LeBron, you threw a lob too high for Tristan. Turnover No. 6 for you. No applause for you."
996143812022947840,2018-05-14 21:42:46,"On LeBron's ""total recall,"" the reporter was asking WHY the Cavs collapsed to open the 4th q, not HOW. LeBron dodged question by reciting play by play the reporter already had. For that he deserved applause???"

995781079616270336,2018-05-13 21:41:24,This game has turned into an embarrassment for LeBron James. I'm will go into detail live on Facebook when this game mercifully ends. See you then.
995777021056663553,2018-05-13 21:25:17,"LeBron, ""saving his energy"" on defense again. Translation: dogging it, letting Marcus Smart hit a wide-open 3 on him."

Isn't that what he's ALWAYS supposed to do? Ever watch Manu Ginobili play no matter the score? Greatest charge-taker ever."

995767252786937857,2018-05-13 20:46:28,"I can't believe the Celtics just shut down the King. Only 7 points? 3 rebounds? 2 free throws? Only 1 (very difficult) driving shot left-handed off glass? Badly outplayed by Jaylen Brown (18 &amp; 7)? Snap out of it, King!"
995758612373909505,2018-05-13 20:12:08,"LeBron, who couldn't one time get easily to the basket in the first quarter, would be in even bigger trouble without his bench help. Celts are doing to him what they did to his client Ben Simmons: keeping him out of the lane."
995751745677508608,2018-05-13 19:44:50,Today was supposed to be the culmination of why Kyrie couldn't take LeBron any more and embraced the opportunity in Boston to challenge him.
995750753040941056,2018-05-13 19:40:54,Marcus Morris talked a good game about how he can defend LeBron. But we've seen zero evidence of that.
995750593535721472,2018-05-13 19:40:16,The Pacers truly believed they could hang with LeBron and Co. The Celtics aren't sure.
994985000977117187,2018-05-11 16:58:04,"Raptors can't fire their two ""stars."" So they fired their Coach of the Year."
994976911737536512,2018-05-11 16:25:56,It is laughable that anyone would even try to make the lame case that LeBron James is better than Michael Jordan was.

994411580539355136,2018-05-10 02:59:30,"The Boston Celtics are just a better BASKETBALL TEAM than the Sixers, slicing and dicing on offense and shrewdly stifling on defense. They just play harder and smarter than the Sixers."

994405342783025152,2018-05-10 02:34:43,The Sixers had 'em right where they wanted 'em and the Sixers self-destructed on offense. Just hard to watch. Just like the end of the half when they let the game get away from them. Now they're pretty much finished.
994403798293467136,2018-05-10 02:28:35,"Embiid and Simmons have combined to take four straight terrible shots WITH THE LEAD. Calm down. Quit forcing. Let the game come to you, young men."

994400388647239680,2018-05-10 02:15:02,Embiid is going to have to play smarter and harder ON BOTH ENDS if the Sixers are going to hang in. And he's going to have to create 3 or 4 threes for teammates that must be made.

994040765432004608,2018-05-09 02:26:01,I'm sorry but I have to say it again: Donovan Mitchell was the best rookie in the NBA this season. Just a spectacular scorer and playmaker with Westbrook's will and explosion and midair contortion control.
994039632558895104,2018-05-09 02:21:31,"So many Houston shots fell during that 4th quarter that I'll swear Chris Paul's State Farm agent made one, too."

993689912049192960,2018-05-08 03:11:51,LeBron James is playing the best all-around offensive basketball of his career.
993688819483344896,2018-05-08 03:07:31,Not exactly sure the last four games helped get LeBron's Team ready for the Warriors.
993683108691038208,2018-05-08 02:44:49,"Come on, Bron, just three - no, now just two - more rebounds vs sorry Raptors and YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER PLAYOFF TRIPLE DOUBLE! Stay in the game, even though it's 103-74."
993669838777139200,2018-05-08 01:52:05,LeBron is basically taking the night off vs these sorry Raptors. Can't blame him. Mercy rule! Call off the second half!
993650246629511168,2018-05-08 00:34:14,"The Sixers should've won Games 2 and 3, did win 4 convincingly. But they head back to Boston down 3-1. Would love to see them scratch/claw back into this. But do not love their chances in Game 5."
993649813106315264,2018-05-08 00:32:31,"Against Boston, the Sixers obviously need TJ McConnell on the floor most of the game, with or w/o BenSimmons. TJ helps offset Rozier, zero turnovers tonight, 19 pts on 9-12, plays with moxie and attitude and veteran poise."
993612290715934721,2018-05-07 22:03:25,"Congrats to LeBron for making that shot. But just ONCE I'd love to see him do what he does better than anyone ever, freight-train to the basket ... and have the guts to shoot the free throws if need be. THAT would be greatness."
993611853690429441,2018-05-07 22:01:40,"LeBron tried this same sort of shot at vs Clips at home last Nov. Also tied with overtime as safety net. Tried a running LEFT-hander off glass, missed badly. Clearly shying from the free-throw line."
993611159981862912,2018-05-07 21:58:55,Still not totally convinced LeBron tried to use glass. He was running full speed toward the base line - running OUT OF glass! Did the shot naturally pull left with his momentum? BARELY nicked glass and fell through. Beautiful to watch. Maybe a little lucky.
993610422421831680,2018-05-07 21:55:59,"LeBron, greatest driver of the basketball ever, has late-game free-throw demons. He had missed FTs w 2:38 and :31 left. Tallest Raptor on the floor was 6-9 Siakam. ATTACK! DUNK IT! No, afraid of getting fouled, having to make 1 of 2. Shied from the paint and any contact."
993609337376407557,2018-05-07 21:51:41,"What I can't understand is why LeBron James, guarded by a rookie, would settle for about as difficult a last-sec shot as he could take??? He was either 1) showing off a ""horse"" shot w overtime guaranteed or more likely 2) making sure he avoided having to make 1 of 2 free throws."

993317638095884288,2018-05-07 02:32:34,"Not a fan of CP3's gray-area tactics but at least he remembered in his TNT interview that he once at a 3-1 lead on the way to his 1st conf finals and the ""stuff"" went bad. He knows there's still work to be done. Then it's GoldenSt."
993316679076667392,2018-05-07 02:28:45,Congrats to the Rockets for a gutsy effort winning 2nd straight at Utah. But CP3/Harden/Capella were just too much for Jazz without Rubio and Exum.
993249231233138689,2018-05-06 22:00:45,"As I said last night, wake me up when the Pelicans win Game 4. Nope, Warriors dominated, up 3-1. LeBron is looking at 3-6 in NBA finals with KD winning back-to-back MVPs. He's unstoppable."

992966381040619521,2018-05-06 03:16:48,"Just one free throw, LeBron."
992966194964529152,2018-05-06 03:16:03,This is where LeBron should just drive it and shoot the free throws if need be. But he'll shoot a jumper.
992965751949574144,2018-05-06 03:14:18,Notice how LeBron inbounded there so he didn't have to get fouled and shoot these free throws?
992965224167686144,2018-05-06 03:12:12,obvious foul on Ibaka.
992964658033127424,2018-05-06 03:09:57,"Come on, Bron, put these poor Raptors out of their misery."
992963254971383811,2018-05-06 03:04:23,LeBron can do that EVERY TIME if he wants.

992950639599611905,2018-05-06 02:14:15,Drama King.
992944406176002048,2018-05-06 01:49:29,Shocking. LeBron badly missed his two fadeaways and his only 3 ... and the Cavs still lead the sorry Raptors by 15.
992931052791349253,2018-05-06 00:56:25,Kevin Love is playing BIG - just as he did when LeBron checked out of Game 7 for 5 crucial minutes with a 1-point lead and returned to a 12-point lead. Thanks to Love.
992928801557364737,2018-05-06 00:47:28,"Incredibly, for most of this series, LeBron James has been guarded by A ROOKIE, Anunoby."

992924256144048128,2018-05-06 00:29:24,LeBron in Game 1 at Toronto: 1-8 from 3. 1-6 from the free-throw line. And the Cavs still won!
992923353873694720,2018-05-06 00:25:49,"WARNING FOR BLIND WITNESSES: Your man LeBron fell in love with a new shot, the MJ fadeaway, with zero front-running pressure vs sorry Raptors. History says this will come back to haunt him the next time a game matters. He's still a streaky-at-best outside and FT shooter."
992922495085821957,2018-05-06 00:22:25,I've had people inside the Sixers tell me they think Ben Simmons will be even better than Embiid long term. Haven't once seen that vs Celtics.
992918787409174528,2018-05-06 00:07:41,"That last Celts play was NOT DRAWN UP FOR AL HORFORD. That was about the 5th option and they barely got the ball in before 5 seconds. Embiid switched. Desperation lob to Horford on Covington. Doubt that was ""Brad Stevens genius,"" as good a coach as he is."
992917275970752512,2018-05-06 00:01:40,How many times did 7-foot point guard Ben Simmons let the offense degenerate into Embiid forcing up solo shots on Horford or Redick or Belinelli forcing up desperation 3s? Just ugly.
992916660771217410,2018-05-05 23:59:14,"I picked the Sixers to beat LeBron in the East finals, and I was very wrong. Celts are a nightmare matchup because they know how to play and the Sixers don't yet. So LeBron gets Boston without Kyrie and Hayward. Advantage, King."
992915899832090624,2018-05-05 23:56:12,"The Sixers didn't deserve to win that game, and they didn't. You can't keep giving a team as mentally tough as Boston chance after chance with dumb turnover and dumb shot after turnover after shot and hope to survive."
992915361879146496,2018-05-05 23:54:04,Ben Simmons just shrank. And his team is done.
992911115045691392,2018-05-05 23:37:11,Rozier even got away with grabbing Belinelli's jersey before he broke free for that shot. Almost deserved an and-one on continuation but not quite.
992910524517007360,2018-05-05 23:34:51,Confetti delay will cost the Sixers some momentum. Somebody jumped the gun in Sixers ops.
992909958168567808,2018-05-05 23:32:36,What a season-saving shot falling out of bounds by Marco Belinelli. Took Redick and Simmons off the choke hook. Now can Philly make the most of a second chance?
992907139956985856,2018-05-05 23:21:24,Time for Ben Simmons to atone and live up.
992906586317180928,2018-05-05 23:19:12,Philly needs McConnell on Rozier. No one else can begin to hang with him or bother him.
992905456065462272,2018-05-05 23:14:42,"OH, NOOOOOO, Ben Simmons."
992891586500440064,2018-05-05 22:19:35,Sixers shot 42% from 3 yet the Boston Celtics ... just ... won't ... go ... away. Down only 3 at half with pressure ... mounting ... on ... the ... favored ... home ... team.
992237779701530624,2018-05-04 03:01:36,LeBron just got ANOTHER big break. I'm about to go live on Facebook and talk about it. JOIN ME.
992236303344267264,2018-05-04 02:55:44,I never would've believed it: But Terry Rozier has turned into Kyrie Irving.
992231295328567296,2018-05-04 02:35:50,"If the Sixers are going to survive this game, Ben Simmons is going to have to come back in and play like the rookie of the year instead of an overmatched, out-of-control second-year player."
992227458446315522,2018-05-04 02:20:35,"It was no joke or aberration that the Celts were the NBA's No. 1 defensive team all season long. Now they have locked up the Sixers and are forcing them into shot after terrible contested shot. Philly, No. 2 in D, now looks like No. 22. Big trouble for Philly."
992220252313346048,2018-05-04 01:51:57,"I moved from my TV room into the living room when the Sixers were in command. I told my wife Ernestine this is dangerous. I sat on the couch watching the Celts roar back and the Sixers lose their 3-pt-shooting minds. Sorry, my dear, I'm moving back into my TV room for 2nd half."
992217937615335424,2018-05-04 01:42:45,The Sixers will take a 4-point halftime lead at Boston - but not that way. This game was OVER. Almost felt like the Sixers were running it up and rubbing it in. Now this game is just starting and the home team has all the momentum.
992199273327423488,2018-05-04 00:28:35,JOIN ME LIVE ON FACEBOOK AS SOON AS THIS GAME ENDS FOR MY IMMEDIATE THOUGHTS ON LEBRON'S KINGLY GAME.
992198048695500800,2018-05-04 00:23:43,I like this fadeaway by LeBron because he knows it's high degree of difficulty and that he's not EXPECTED to make it. He can shoot it freely with full follow-through instead of the nervous-handed 3s he feels pressure to make. He was 1-8 from 3 in Game 1.
992194985167544320,2018-05-04 00:11:33,Poor Toronto.
992193695398023168,2018-05-04 00:06:25,Now LeBron is just clowning the poor Raptors and their fans with these fadeaways he borrowed from MJ just as he did No. 23.
992193145793232896,2018-05-04 00:04:14,Looks like Ty Lue was right to stick with Kevin Love. 27 and 9 through 3 quarters. He's playing like a 5-time All-Star - WHICH HE IS. Guess my partner LeShannon Sharpe is going to have to quit ripping the poor guy. All Love did was save the season while LBJ checked out of Game 7.

991873759471529984,2018-05-03 02:55:07,I don't believe in the Harden/CP3/D'Antoni Rockets almost as much as I don't believe in the Raptors.
991873118154076161,2018-05-03 02:52:34,"What Utah just did at Houston was so impressive because it doesn't have its QB, Rubio. Obviously, Ingles won't keep making 7 threes &amp; the Rockets won't keep shooting 27% from three. But this Utah team is MENTALLY TOUGHER than the Rockets."
991871487136096256,2018-05-03 02:46:05,"Donovan Mitchell just showed once again why he should be Rookie of the Year. Made play after play down the stretch at Houston, attacking the rim and defending Harden. Utah now has a Harden, a Westbrook: DONOVAN MITCHELL."

991511925476417536,2018-05-02 02:57:19,I had faith in the Cavs tonight mostly because I do not trust the Raptors in games of this magnitude. And that's what just happened.
991510485689237505,2018-05-02 02:51:35,That was just a pathetic possession.

991504640746246144,2018-05-02 02:28:22,THAT IS A TICKY TACK FOUL CALL. SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN CALLED. WASN'T BLATANT ON LEBRON'S PART.

991495459297312768,2018-05-02 01:51:53,Play Tristan Thompson the rest of the way.
991491900233334785,2018-05-02 01:37:44,I've been saying throughout the playoffs that LeBron constantly steps across the line with his 498th new free-throw routine. It has been working ... until tonight. But they finally called him for a violation.
991486135288283136,2018-05-02 01:14:50,"Come on, Bron. 1-5 from the free-throw line??? Need you, big man. Help your help!"
991475857486004224,2018-05-02 00:33:59,I pick LeBron's Team to win tonight and he runs out of gas IN THE FIRST QUARTER. He led the NBA in minutes played in the regular season and in the 1st round of the playoffs and he has to sit 8 minutes into what's turning into a disaster. I guess the joke's on me.
991451517373722625,2018-05-01 22:57:16,"Join me live on Facebook in just a few minutes to talk LeBron, NBA playoffs, Kawhi to Philly?"
991450611106246656,2018-05-01 22:53:40,No surprise to me that reportedly 6 teams at or near top of draft preferred Baker Mayfield. I said all along that clearly he performed the best of any of the top QBs and is an extremely competitive leader. Off-field risks did not scare them off.
991449765610057728,2018-05-01 22:50:19,I take back the compliment I paid Belichick for opting not to trade up for a top QB to replace Brady. BakerMayfield's agent now says Pats wanted BAKER at 2 but Browns took him. Giants would've had Pats' 2 firsts and 2 seconds! No new help for Brady! Unreal.
991429633622007808,2018-05-01 21:30:19,"I will go live on Facebook around 7 E to talk if I think LeBron is ""burnt,"" if he'll sweep Toronto, if Sixers are in trouble and if they will trade for Kawhi. JOIN ME THEN."

991146120494571522,2018-05-01 02:43:44,All you need to know is the Celtics outscored the Sixers by 36 from the 3-point line and won by 16. That will not continue.

991109142642245632,2018-05-01 00:16:48,"As much as I like Victor Oladipo, with LeBron out of the game for about 5 crucial minutes, he did nothing. Pacers had their opening to take control. Couldn't. They could keep coming back/hanging around, but didn't believe they could dethrone."
991107647704260609,2018-05-01 00:10:51,"For whatever weird reason, LeBron checked out of yesterday's Game7 w 1 minute left in the 3rd. A 12-pt halftime lead had crumbled to 1. Seconds after he returned about 5 mins later, Cavs led by 12. Kevin Love had hit two 3s &amp; a jumper. Game basically over. Love saved the season."
991106058641858560,2018-05-01 00:04:32,"As a Cowboy fan, I fear these players the Cowboys did not draft will come back to haunt them: DJ Moore, Rashaan Evans, Dallas Goedert, James Washington and Obo Okoronkwo. Sure hope I'm wrong."

All played Game 7 big in Game 7 ... especially when LeBron was out with ""cramps"" or a ""minor injury"" or why ever he seized up when the game tightened"
990680789359640576,2018-04-29 19:54:40,Congratulations to Victor Oladipo's Team for taking LeBron James' Team to the brink in Game 7. Actually outplayed the Cavs overall. Way to go.
990674420472528896,2018-04-29 19:29:22,What?! Whatever it takes.
990673932909871105,2018-04-29 19:27:26,"Hmmm. That was a quick goal-tend call and LeBron's wasn't at the end of Game 5??? Whatever it takes, refs."

990671317585178624,2018-04-29 19:17:02,Drama King.
990671003175997440,2018-04-29 19:15:47,"LeBron sure has had a lot of help while he has been out with ""cramps."""
990670747835056128,2018-04-29 19:14:46,"Of course, if the Cavs somehow manage to lose this game, LeBron now has his excuse.""Cramps."""
990670367768199168,2018-04-29 19:13:16,"When LeBron was in Miami, a Heat source told me the Heat training staff found that LeBron cramped under pressure. I wrote that for https://t.co/MTGersKKuG after Game 1 of the 2014 Finals, when LeBron was the only player on the court who cramped when the air conditioning failed."
990659066555846656,2018-04-29 18:28:21,"Defending LeBron with just one guy, the Pacers have blown out the Cavs twice and won 1 close game, while the Cavs have won 3 close games. Advantage, Pacers. But it appears LeBron has saved his best for last."
990658190177021952,2018-04-29 18:24:52,I've been perplexed for seven straight games over the way Nate McMillan defends LeBron with just 1 no-help guy. LeBron could score just about every time if he wanted. Today he has had a hot hand from outside as well. But I can't argue with the outcomes of the previous six games.
990657399869460480,2018-04-29 18:21:44,"I've said maybe 10 times on Undisputed over the last 10 days: ""Play Tristan Thompson!"" 10 points, 9 rebounds - 4 offensive. Cavs win the boards by 7. TT changed the game. LeBron had HELP."
990637115422593024,2018-04-29 17:01:08,LeBron should win this home Game 7 by at least 10.
990419170129924096,2018-04-29 02:35:05,Sixers in six over Celts.
990418338068090880,2018-04-29 02:31:47,"Amazing achievement by the Celtics, winning their 1st round series without 2 All-Stars, Kyrie &amp; Gordon Hayward. So well coached. So tough, smart on D. ""Scary Terry"" Rozier has some Kyrie in him. Jayson/Jaylen becoming stars. Won't be any pushover for Sixers."
990354687688765440,2018-04-28 22:18:52,Bo Scarbrough can be a downhill punisher behind a dominating line - and the Cowboys might provide that. He won't make anyone miss or create holes. No Zeke in him. But could provide quality backup and change of pace.
990348046167781376,2018-04-28 21:52:28,"Not sure what Belichick/Mc/Daniels see in Danny Etling. Llast thing I saw was: ""Potential Next Brady."" Or even, ""Potential Next Jimmy G."" Brady will feel no threat - which isn't a good thing.  He's psycho-motivated by challenges. But he still knows his coach wanted to retire him."
990308132919263232,2018-04-28 19:13:52,"I absolutely loved Tavon Austin before the 2013 draft but as a Ram, he never quite lived up to being taken 8th overall. I like the Cowboys getting him for only a 6th-rounder. Maybe Linehan can use him the way Pats do James White while Beasley/Switzer are more Edelman/Amendola."
990286204510789632,2018-04-28 17:46:44,"Mel Kiper on the man who built the Eagles' championship team: ""Howie Roseman knows this league better than anybody."" AND HE DIDN'T EVEN PLAY HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS! How can he know football if he didn't even play it? Why is Michael Jordan the NBA's worst team builder? Hmmm."
990283823492427778,2018-04-28 17:37:16,I grew up in Oklahoma City and I hoped against hope Russ/PG/Melo would find a flow and get on a playoff roll. Game 5 was all-time amazing. But the problem was a team I loved all season: Utah. It was simply the better TEAM.
990283008253947904,2018-04-28 17:34:02,"In the end, as always, it was Russ or bust for OKC. He took 43 shots! Took 19 threes! Kept them barely in the game on sheer solo will. But he remains so difficult to play with. Somewhere Kevin Durant is saying, ""Told you so."""
990281644719329280,2018-04-28 17:28:37,Paul George turned back into George Paul in a do-or-die Game 6. 2-15. 0-6 from 3. 6 turnovers. 5 points. And I thought he'd be a little better Oladipo for Russ. Good luck to the team that gives him the max thinking he's a savior.
990280658885885953,2018-04-28 17:24:42,"I've watched the Gobert on PGeorge noncall about 100 times. Obviously, JHarden gets that call and 3 FTs every time. PGeorge should've gotten this call. But he did lean sideways, he hadn't made a 3 and OKC was playing such ugly basketball that the refs looked the other way."
990279233728528384,2018-04-28 17:19:02,"I was so wrong about the Thunder. I might never recover from the end of last night's G6. Six straight missed shots in that last-min possession, 3 by Russ, 3 by George Paul. Just ugly. OKC Blunder. I thought we'd see Playoff Melo. He's now just another Anthony."
990268828272676864,2018-04-28 16:37:41,"Browns should just go ahead &amp; start Baker Mayfield Day 1. Stage won't be too big for HIM. Let him fire away to Josh Gordon, Jarvis Landry, Corey Coleman, Antonio Callaway, Njoku &amp; hand or toss to Chubb, Duke or Carlos Hyde. Watch Browns head straight north in the North."
990078187651584000,2018-04-28 04:00:09,I don't love OKC's chances of staying alive in the 2nd half. Once more it has become Russ or bust. At Utah I'm not sure he and he alone will be enough.
990053066601783296,2018-04-28 02:20:20,Was I ever wrong about LeBron tonight.
990052696110465024,2018-04-28 02:18:51,Ozzie strikes AGAIN: I also watched every college game Mark Andrews played. He JUST GETS OPEN. Big rangy tough target with good hands. Someday soon he'll be catching TD passes from a Lamar Jackson protected by Orlando Brown.
990051948559679489,2018-04-28 02:15:53,Lance Stephenson gets NO CALLS and virtually no respect from the refs. No doubt much of his reputation is self-inflicted. But he plays hard and he makes plays and does not deserve this blatantly unfair treatment.
990050877342822400,2018-04-28 02:11:38,I do not care about what Orlando Brown did or didn't do at the combine. I watched every game he played at OU. He DOMINATES. Another terrific pick by Ozzie.
990050274017329152,2018-04-28 02:09:14,I did not watch Michael Gallup so I have no personal opinion. I like what I hear and read about him. Could be pretty good. But I'm pretty sure he's no DJ Moore. And he's definitely no 2014 Dez.
990047156366069761,2018-04-28 01:56:50,Lord have mercy: The Pacers are EMBARRASING LeBron's Team. I thought they'd be demoralized by getting robbed thanks to LeBron's uncalled goal tend. They were inspired.
990039394785488896,2018-04-28 01:26:00,"I watched former kicker David Akers ridicule Cowboy fans at JerryWorld before announcing the pick of his former team, the Eagles. REMEMBER: 1) Akers' Eagles played the Cowboys once in the playoffs and lost 34-14 and 2) Akers wasn't a real football player."
990037321859780608,2018-04-28 01:17:46,"Stunning: Oladipo just went LeBron on the Cavs. Welcome back, Victor. LeBron is playing with lower energy tonight. Does he want another stat-building Game 7 at home on Sunday???"
990034833874214913,2018-04-28 01:07:53,"There went DJ Chark, another receiver who intrigued me. Wonder if Arizona would take the Cowboys' third-round pick for Brice Butler?"
990033473430732800,2018-04-28 01:02:28,"Oh, well, there went James Washington, to the Steelers. I can't argue with taking an offensive lineman with the 18th pick in the second round, but I would've been great with JW there, as I tweeted. He has a subtle gear of deep speed Dak would've loved."
990024773886398465,2018-04-28 00:27:54,"I like this pick. Connor Williams, native Texan, is a potential stud offensive lineman who can play every position. Ty Smith struggles to stay healthy. Cowboys sure could've used Connor Williams at Atlanta."
990023174006816768,2018-04-28 00:21:33,"Apparently the Eagles thought the Cowboys were sitting on a potential Witten replacement appropriately named Dallas (Goedert). So Howie Roseman traded up to snatch him. Way to go, Howie."

990018933162889216,2018-04-28 00:04:41,"I'm afraid the Pacers are done tonight, deflated from being robbed on LeBron's goal tend. Oladipo has been lousy the last 4 games after a breakout season and breakout Game 1. He has reverted. Lance is the only hope. LeBron by 10."
990015990262988800,2018-04-27 23:53:00,Gesicki goes to Dolphins: ANOTHER receiver I hoped would fall to the Cowboys. Will have impact. Hard to cover.

989883609652723712,2018-04-27 15:06:58,"Baker Mayfield played way better than any of these other QBs. For the last two years, he led all of college football in Total QBR. That's hard to do. More @Undisputed, now on FS1 https://t.co/G5ReVHtFhz"
989857222694846464,2018-04-27 13:22:07,"NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe and I are about to debate Baker Mayfield vs Sam Darnold, Lamar Jackson to Ravens, Cowboys shocking pick, Patriots surprising strategy, comments made by Josh Rosen and Josh Allen, and Saquon Barkley to the Giants. @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1"
989723825897025538,2018-04-27 04:32:02,"THE place to hear the best draft debate is Undisputed tomorrow 9:30-noon E, FS1, as I match opinions and wits with 3-ring NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe. JOIN US."
989712888515330050,2018-04-27 03:48:35,"The more I think about the Cowboys' pick, the more it scares me. I'm having flashbacks to the Gil Brandt reach/bust picks of the '80s, when he tried to show the league he knew something nobody else did. I'm even thinking Mike Mamula. Please tell me I'm wrong."
989711576935493633,2018-04-27 03:43:22,"Lamar Jackson obviously has rare breakaway speed, but he also has a lightning release and can flick the ball with underrated velocity. He thrived in Petrino's demanding pro-style passing game. His college production was spectacular. Congrats, Raven Nation."
989710211089776640,2018-04-27 03:37:56,I LIKE LAMAR JACKSON MUCH BETTER IN BALTIMORE THAN I WOULD HAVE IN BOSTON.
989710037105852416,2018-04-27 03:37:15,GOOD FOR OZZIE NEWSOME IN HIS LAST DRAFT. JUST TRADED UP TO TAKE LAMAR JACKSON AT 32. I'VE SEEN ENOUGH OF FLUKE-O. I KNOW HE'S BEEN SHOCKINGLY GREAT IN THE PLAYOFFS BUT HE'S BEEN ROUTINELY LOUSY IN REG SEASON. LAMAR IS THE RAVENS FUTURE.
989709146185392128,2018-04-27 03:33:43,"Once again, Brady says, thank you, coach. To me, Sony Michel is as explosive and productive as Saquon. Runs strong AND with effortless acceleration. Very good pick. Knee should hold up fine."
989706870884450309,2018-04-27 03:24:40,"OK, back to the Patriots' reported interest in Lamar Jackson. Real or smokescreen? It would be uncharacteristically unPatriot if it's real. Belichick has never let secrets leak. But now we see."
989701213879848960,2018-04-27 03:02:11,"I'm not the biggest Calvin Ridley fan, but obviously he'll make Matt Ryan's offense even more explosive and fellow Tide product Julio Jones will make sure Ridley sees almost nothing but single coverage."
989698125425065984,2018-04-27 02:49:55,"Steve Smith just spoke the truth ... Carolina has not been able to replace him, until now, with D.J. Moore."
989697547470950400,2018-04-27 02:47:37,"Congrats, Cam. You just got a game-breaking receiver the Cowboys sure could've used: D.J. Moore."
989697260874227712,2018-04-27 02:46:29,"Obviously, unless someone trades up, Belichick could have another shot at Lamar Jackson at 31."
989696719574073344,2018-04-27 02:44:20,"Thank you, Bill Belichick. Brady thanks you, too. Isaiah Wynn is a mauler. Doesn't have prototype size but just steamrolls, at guard or tackle. Kept blowing my Sooners off the line in the national semifinal. Great need pick after losing Solder."
989694532785553409,2018-04-27 02:35:38,Now we see if all the reports about the Patriots loving Lamar Jackson were smokescreens. Now we see if Belichick goes anti-Brady and picks the next Patriots quarterback when they have so many other needs.
989694137602531328,2018-04-27 02:34:04,"I'm thinking the Titans just said, ""Thank you, Cowboys."""
989693879761887232,2018-04-27 02:33:03,"I hate to say it, but Rashaan Evans would've been a safer pick for the Cowboys at linebacker than Vander Esch."
989691894501326848,2018-04-27 02:25:09,What always scares me about kids like Leighton Vander Esch: The entire Cowboys staff/front office fell in love with him BECAUSE HE'S SUCH A LIKABLE KID. But does that cloud their vision of him as a potentially great NFL linebacker??? I don't see Roquan Smith. Hope I'm wrong.
989691139241357312,2018-04-27 02:22:09,"Obviously, Sean Lee's history tells you he just won't stay healthy. I'm not sure Jaylon Smith will ever quite be what he was before his horrific knee injury. Hitchens is history. So LB was an obvious need. But so was a No. 1 receiver."
989690669798117376,2018-04-27 02:20:17,"I watched Leighton Vander Esch just one time, vs Josh Allen. Impressed with his movement - plays LB like a safety. But didn't see physicality. Not a thumper. So ... I can't do cartwheels just yet."
989687249666113537,2018-04-27 02:06:42,I don't like Calvin Ridley nearly as much as I do D.J. Moore.
989687086943948801,2018-04-27 02:06:03,Not sure why Green Bay wanted to trade up ahead of Dallas. Were Packers afraid Dallas would take CB Jaire Alexander? Seriously doubt that.
989685733576163329,2018-04-27 02:00:41,"Raiders' rival, the Chargers, take Derwin James. Has Pro Bowl potential at safety ... to pair with the NFL's best cornerback, Casey Hayward of Vanderbilt University. Chargers have Super Bowl potential NEXT YEAR."
989683646402519040,2018-04-27 01:52:23,I would bet on Tremaine Edmunds becoming a star before I would Josh Allen.
989682492650090497,2018-04-27 01:47:48,Can't argue with Gruden taking Kolton Miller. But the defense sure could've used Derwin James.
989681628682244096,2018-04-27 01:44:22,Raiders should take Derwin James.
989681306932924416,2018-04-27 01:43:05,"Saints trade up from 27 to 14 to take Lamar ... no, the defensive end from UT-San Antonio, Marcus Davenport??? I did not watch him. They must think he's going to be a STAR. Biggest curve ball so far."
989679277858738180,2018-04-27 01:35:01,"Da'Ron Payne (like Vea) is an extraordinary athlete for such a big man. Cowboys could've used him. Now, as a Redskin, he will cause my Cowboys problems for years to come."
989677309572481024,2018-04-27 01:27:12,"Vita Vea is HUGE. Plays big, too. A true interior anchor."
989675730328940545,2018-04-27 01:20:56,"I love Minkah Fitzpatrick almost as much as I do Roquan Smith. Just a football player. Corner, safety, whatever. Knows how to play. Competes. Always around the ball. Congrats, Dolphins."
989674572717768704,2018-04-27 01:16:20,Playing NFL QB requires extreme mental &amp; physical toughness and I'm not sure Josh Rosen has those. Throws a pretty ball. But does he have the intangibles and strength of leadership to take over a team? I have my doubts.
989672346418991105,2018-04-27 01:07:29,"Jimmy G says, thank you, John Lynch. Tom Brady says, man, wish I had a left tackle."
989671225231163392,2018-04-27 01:03:01,"Bears just got a FOOTBALL PLAYER, the best defensive player at his position. Leader, hitter, baller. Another great Bears linebacker. A Chicago-style throwback: Roquan Smith."
989669864166969344,2018-04-27 00:57:37,"I watched Josh Allen at Iowa, at BoiseSt, vs Oregon and in 1st half of Senior Bowl. Just didn't see enough poise, feel, accuracy. Can throw it 80 yards and through a brick wall. But CAN HE PLAY QB? And the high-school tweets gave me pause."
989669096127062017,2018-04-27 00:54:34,"I'm afraid the Bills, who just traded up, are about to swing and miss at a QB."
989667959395074048,2018-04-27 00:50:03,"From all I hear about Quenton Nelson, he's a stud, a Zack Martin. Can't argue. But if I were Denver or Indy, I'd have taken Roquan Smith."
989667230966140928,2018-04-27 00:47:09,"For Elway, who has struggled to pick QBs, Chubb is a safe pick. He'll be a starter and stalwart, but not sure he'll be a star. He's more of an anchor than a difference-maker. Plays stronger than Von Miller but not as slippery and explosive a pass rusher. Elway did pick Von."
989666199192518657,2018-04-27 00:43:03,I believe John Elway would've taken Baker Mayfield. Now I'll be surprised if he takes a QB.
989665307735162880,2018-04-27 00:39:31,"I like Denzel Ward more than Bradley Chubb ... even though Ward had a long night against Baker Mayfield, who planted his flag at the Horseshoe. But I can see Ward being more productive than Chubb."
989663011496386562,2018-04-27 00:30:23,"For the Jets' sake, I hope Sam Darnold isn't the turnover machine he was at USC. I doubt Tom Brady won't lose any sleep tonight."
989662295084036096,2018-04-27 00:27:32,"Again, I don't LOVE any of these QBs. But I do like BakerMayfield to the Browns. He will take over the franchise and locker room. Pressure/expectation will never bother him. He will make plays. He will talk trash. He will make the Browns a story again."
989661471125651457,2018-04-27 00:24:16,"I don't blame the Giants for taking Saquon. GREAT young man. However good he can be, he will be. But he is no Zeke as a RB. Look at what happened last year at OhioSt and MichSt. Won't be a life-changer. But will help aging Eli."
989660500144279552,2018-04-27 00:20:24,"Incredibly, a kid who had to walk on at Texas Tech, who clashed with Kliff Kingsbury and walked on at Oklahoma, is now the first pick in the draft."
989657462729920512,2018-04-27 00:08:20,"My problem with Darnold is the shocking number of turnovers and sacks last season. Led nation in fumbles lost. 13 INTs. 29 sacks. Great kid who tries too hard, loses poise. Will he crumble under high-pick pressure?"
989656678093090816,2018-04-27 00:05:13,"I've been saying for two months on Undisputed, don't be surprised if the Browns take Baker Mayfield. If he can stay out of trouble, he'll be better than the other QBs. But that's a pretty big if. Like Manziel, Baker skilled at telling adults what they want to hear. Eddie Haskell."
989655500512899072,2018-04-27 00:00:32,Problem now for the Browns is BakerMayfield DOES have some off-field Manziel potential - and they wasted a pick on a Johnny who went over the edge into substance abuse. Mayfield likes the nightlife and promoting himself on social media. If he stays out of trouble ...
989654000617205760,2018-04-26 23:54:35,"1 year ago I said if Cleveland doesn't take Deshaun Watson, it will make a monumental mistake. Now I'm not as sold on any of these QBs, but the one who PLAYED the best (by far) is BakerMayfield. High football IQ, careful risk-taker, extreme accuracy and competitiveness."
989618538334773248,2018-04-26 21:33:40,"The best football player in this draft is Roquan Smith. Leader, hitter, gamer, football player."
989618016273944576,2018-04-26 21:31:35,The best receiver in this draft is D.J. Moore - just exploded off my screen every time I watched him. I'd be very happy if the Cowboys managed to draft him. Dak would be even happier.

989494697381969920,2018-04-26 13:21:34,Why the refs let LeBron go from goat to hero. @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1
989360044629049344,2018-04-26 04:26:30,"Good for Oladipo calling out the refs for missing the obvious late goal tend on LeBron. I called it immediately. Changes everything. No way LeBron hits that shot after that blunder, when it's do-or-die down 2. Indiana obviously got robbed."
989354911828590594,2018-04-26 04:06:06,Utah was ahead 71-46! And lost by 8!
989354436827856896,2018-04-26 04:04:13,Game 6 will be very different at Utah. But I still give the Thunder a shot. And OKC definitely wins a Game 7 back in the Thunderdome.
989353942155849728,2018-04-26 04:02:15,"Russ finally just said, ""Let ME do this."" That was the only way."
989353436415123456,2018-04-26 04:00:15,"Incredibly, Russell Westbrook has brought OKC back from 25 down midway through the 3rd q vs a very good, hot team. I thought there was NO WAY. But he hit one 3, then another, then he unleashed (with Gobert on the bench in foul trouble)."
989346127928422400,2018-04-26 03:31:12,"Stop the presses: Russ might've just SAVED his legacy by willing OKC back into tie with a 20-point 3rd quarter. Now OKC leads, with Russ-stopper Gobert in foul trouble."
989339441536745472,2018-04-26 03:04:38,Wonder if LeBron is missing DWade and Jae Crowder about now?
989334489754030080,2018-04-26 02:44:57,"Russell Westbrook's legacy is about to take a major hit. After so many big regular-season wins with PG and Melo, and after a dominant G1 win over Utah, Russ's Team has degenerated into disconnected solo acts and 4 straight losses."
989333133467140096,2018-04-26 02:39:34,Ingles &amp; Crowder have hit 4 threes each. OKC has hit 2 total. That's 18 more points. 56-41 Utah at half. Thunder are done.
989328607070715904,2018-04-26 02:21:35,"By the way, LeBron now has only 4 last-second game-winning jump shots in 1,142 regular-season games and incredibly, only 2 in 222 playoff games. These are rare for him. Never his strength. Enjoy this one."
989323510286708736,2018-04-26 02:01:20,I can't wait to see Uncle Shannon tomorrow at 9:30 E on FS1's Undisputed. How will he celebrate losing to me AGAIN???
989323083650498566,2018-04-26 01:59:38,"Just hard to believe Victor Ola-uh-oh shot 2-15 yet wound up with the ball and a chance to win the game with 5 seconds left. At 6-4, threw up an absurd prayer against the 6-9 LeBron. But after Indy's G1 blowout, that's 4 straight games that have gone to the wire. Not great, King."
989320993456832512,2018-04-26 01:51:20,"Huge shot, LeBron. Season saver. He has always been at his best when there's no decision to make, no fear of the last-second free-throw line, no ""drive it or jack it up?"" He went straight up and let it fly WITH CONVICTION. Nothing but net. LeBron at his greatest."
989319886043152384,2018-04-26 01:46:56,"Thank you, LeBron, for winning me my bet with my Shannon Sharpe. He gave me 6 1/2. I did not love my chances in overtime. King me! I win yet another case of Diet Dew."
989318947353772032,2018-04-26 01:43:12,That sure looked like goal tending.
989315453968306176,2018-04-26 01:29:19,"What a night for the notoriously poor shooting LeBron at the free throw line: 15-15! At this rate, he'll wind up 20-20."
989315059187773440,2018-04-26 01:27:45,LeBron James is the greatest driver of the basketball ever.
989313268391923714,2018-04-26 01:20:38,Terrible call. Foul on LeBron. No charge.
989310140489785344,2018-04-26 01:08:12,Can somebody please explain why Lance played only the last couple of minutes of a third quarter the Pacers lost 32-17?
989305727528284160,2018-04-26 00:50:40,The King is building this all-time stat castle but only one matters: 6-0 vs 3-5. And the 3-5 includes the all-time superstar meltdown in the 2011 Finals and Ray Allen saving LeBron from 2-6 with the greatest clutch shot ever after LeBron had missed the tying 3.
989303944508719104,2018-04-26 00:43:35,"LET LANCE OUT OF THE DOGHOUSE, NATE, AND PUT HIM BACK IN."
989303631072575488,2018-04-26 00:42:20,Victor Oladipo has turned back into ... Victor Oladipo.
989298287126528000,2018-04-26 00:21:06,"Just hard to believe LeBron has scored at will, and Oladipo and Collison have been pretty awful, and the Pacers are up 7 at half. Does not bode well for the Pacers."
989296988465197056,2018-04-26 00:15:56,"I'm impressed that for the first time in three games, LeBron hasn't played his energy-saving one-man zone defense under the basket.  But that has allowed Indy some paint mismatches and easier baskets. Bet LBJ goes zone in 3rd q."
989294557496930304,2018-04-26 00:06:17,"I swear LeBron could shoot a layup every time down if he wanted. Pacers will not double him, try to get the ball out of his hands. Make nonLeBrons beat 'em. Lance is the only single defender who remotely bothers him."
989290153708433408,2018-04-25 23:48:47,Looks like the Pacers are saving themselves for Game 6.
989289347491889152,2018-04-25 23:45:35,"Just hard to believe the Pacers played SO POORLY and SO TIMIDLY and were outhustled to so many 50-50 balls and they somehow lead by 2 after one. If the Cavs' threes start falling, this will get ugly."
989288362107224064,2018-04-25 23:41:40,"LeBron can score so easily against these Pacers. Layup after layup. Remember, these aren't exactly the '98 Reggie Miller Pacers who took MJ to Game 7 in the East finals."
989286188115677185,2018-04-25 23:33:01,"As I said on Undisputed today, LeBron with his 768th new free-throw routine, steps over the line every time before the ball touches anything. Should be called. Never is. But I do like the new form on his shot. Much less awkward."
989281351466500096,2018-04-25 23:13:48,Shocking news: LaVar reportedly pulls 2 younger sons out of Lithuania because he got mad at the coach. Starting to feel like the only way any of his sons will ever reach their potential is if LaVar coaches them. Maybe in the BIG3?
989280748325687296,2018-04-25 23:11:25,"I expect LeBron to come out in full attack mode, try to go for 20-something in the 1st q like G2. Then we'll see if he can sustain it ... or if he plays any defense."

988973795116400641,2018-04-25 02:51:41,Congratulations to the San Antonio Spurs for a season to be proud of after their best player quit on them after playing a mere nine games.

988770660599058434,2018-04-24 13:24:30,"We're about to debate Russell Westbrook, Baker Mayfield to the Browns, Lamar Jackson to the Patriots, Julio Jones, JR/Lance, Dez. @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1"
988611999515865088,2018-04-24 02:54:02,Donovan Westbrook.
988607496297238528,2018-04-24 02:36:09,I did not love what Russ called Rubio's game. That will ignite the Jazz and their crowd. But I did love that (apparently) KD took another subtle shot at Russ. Hoping THAT will ignite Russ. I'm sticking with OKC.
988606459553267713,2018-04-24 02:32:02,The T-Wolves don't play up to their talent under their current coach ... which makes it hard to be too impressed about what James Harden and Co. just did to Minnesota at Minnesota.
988518620614479872,2018-04-23 20:42:59,The turning point last night was Lance goading LeBron into the tech that made it Pacers 92-89 ... immediately undone by Lance's forgetting to dribble as he brought the ball up court. So sly ... so not on this planet.
988516460325564416,2018-04-23 20:34:24,"The Cavs got annihilated in Game 1 by the Pacers, then in Games 2, 3 and 4 allowed the Pacers to come back from (in order) 18, 17 and 16 down. Last nite Indy led by 3 w/ 6 mins left, then missed 9 of 10 shots. Cavs aren't exactly in charge of this 2-2 series, are they?"
988514799045689344,2018-04-23 20:27:48,"At age 34, Michael Jordan made 1st-team all-NBA defensive team. At age 33 this season LeBron finished 309th in the NBA in defensive win shares and his team finished 29th in defense, second to last."
988513741867073536,2018-04-23 20:23:36,"When it comes to playing defense, he's now LeNone."

988407927932268545,2018-04-23 13:23:08,Also today: Should Russ have disrespected Rubio? Do Brady and Gronk deserve to hold a grudge over Malcolm Butler? Any surprise no one has jumped to sign Dez? Will Shannon dare to disrespect Manu this time? @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1
988407156335493121,2018-04-23 13:20:04,Shannon and I are about to go at it over the Lance Stephenson/Jeff Green call. @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1
988258471614169088,2018-04-23 03:29:15,Lance did not put Jeff Green in a headlock. He had his hands on the ball while reaching around Green's head. That was a reputation foul called on Lance and it cost Indiana a last-gasp chance. That was a protect-LeBron call.
988256871059410944,2018-04-23 03:22:53,Don't tell me LeBron doesn't have any help: Those two late Kyle Korver threes changed the game and the Eastern Conference playoffs.
988256006319652864,2018-04-23 03:19:27,"How was that a ""hostile act"" on Lance's part any more than it was on Jeff Green's part??? They were both just battling for the ball. Tie ball. Jump it. Green probably wins the jump but you never know."
988255195627798528,2018-04-23 03:16:14,That should just be a jump ball. Awful call. No free throw.
988254049047740416,2018-04-23 03:11:40,"The Pacers had it and blew it, collapsing into a momentum-killing parade of forced up one-on-one possessions. Oladipo (4-19) was particularly awful when his team, with an historic upset in its grasp, needed him most."
988251925731721216,2018-04-23 03:03:14,That was obviously a tie ball. Ref gifted LeBron with the time out.
988248196416598016,2018-04-23 02:48:25,Why doesn't LeBron just ATTACK??? Lance can't keep him from the rim or the free throw line.
988245103427731456,2018-04-23 02:36:08,LeBron expended very little energy that quarter on offense or especially defense. Just distributed and stood under the basket playing 1-man zone. Now his tank should still be full enough to go into attack mode and put this game away.
988234398578327552,2018-04-23 01:53:35,Now it's up to LeBron to take his energy up another level and PUT THIS GAME AWAY. He's found a nice soft-handed free-throw groove tonight so that shouldn't be the usual problem.
988226170817691649,2018-04-23 01:20:54,"Only JR Swish could pull off such a crazy hard shot, dribbling to his left, launching across his body from three quarters court, ripping it cleanly at the first quarter buzzer. What a shooter &amp; defender he is when he's locked in."
988214112571162624,2018-04-23 00:32:59,The Cavs should win tonight's game by 10.
988175216848191488,2018-04-22 21:58:25,Hard to watch injured Steph Curry bounce off the bench to cheerlead and congratulate teammates while Kawhi ... is nowhere to be seen.
988174841365778432,2018-04-22 21:56:56,"Manu Ginobili, who should be the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year, just did it AGAIN. Said no to KD/Dubs smelling sweep. Bradyesque at 40.True clutch greatness. Privilege to watch. Thank you, Manu."
988142061009256448,2018-04-22 19:46:40,"Still not sure why Celts went to Marcus Morris for last shot when Jaylen Brown, Tatum and Rozier had hotter hands. Such an amazing rally, then that?"
988140590452817920,2018-04-22 19:40:50,Still not sure how Middleton dislodged the ball from Jaylen Brown on what looked like a pretty easy break basket that would've put Celts in commanding position with 40 secs left. Play of Game.
987803808825856000,2018-04-21 21:22:35,"DWade was again vintage clutch down the stretch, nearly won it for the Heat. You don't think LeBron could've used him last night in the 2nd half at Pacers??? I do. Huge loss for the Cavs."
987803246713548800,2018-04-21 21:20:21,Maybe it would be better if LeBron doesn't have to lose to the Sixers in this year's East finals so he can join them without as much criticism next year.
987802873638551554,2018-04-21 21:18:52,"Think about this: At Miami, Embiid had 8 turnovers, BenSimmons had 7 and the Sixers had 26 turnovers ... and they won by 4. Firepower. Starpower. New beasts of the East."
987509909896953856,2018-04-21 01:54:44,"Now LeBron must do in Game 4 in Indy what he should've done tonight: Play with far more wire-to-wire deal-closing energy. Too often listless and lifeless in tonight's second half. And please don't tell me the ""Best Player on the Planet"" needs more help vs the Pacers."
987508985505951745,2018-04-21 01:51:03,"In the end, best thing that happened for the Pacers was Collison missing his 2nd free throw bc Cavs had no time outs. Maybe missed on purpose. Love wasn't able to throw another amazing pass to LeBron for a desperation 3. JR had to take it on the run, missed badly."
987507984417935360,2018-04-21 01:47:05,Still in shock over what I just Witnessed: A team led by LeBron James being guarded by Bogdanovic blew a 17-point halftime lead by scoring 12 points in the 3rd quarter and 21 in the 4th. Impossible. Shameful.
987469338331541504,2018-04-20 23:13:31,I said on Undisputed that LeBron will win this game by 10.
987323096528052225,2018-04-20 13:32:24,"Thanks, Kawhi."
987322896115781635,2018-04-20 13:31:36,"As NFL schedules go, the Cowboys' isn't terribly tough. If Sean Lee and Ty Smith stay healthy for 16 games, and Zeke stays eligible, and they draft a receiver who contributes right away ..."
987314884609236992,2018-04-20 12:59:46,"No Undisputed today. Sorry. Joy, Shannon and I return Monday. I'm taking this opportunity to speak today at my school Vanderbilt, best school in America, which has now produced the NFL's best cornerback, Casey Hayward. Commodores forever."
987146964558057473,2018-04-20 01:52:31,"Embiid is back with a vengeance. I'm sorry, LeBron, but Sixers got Next. Now."

986958494950555650,2018-04-19 13:23:36,"Also today: The Thunder collapse, why the Sixers won't let Embiid play, why Brady takes so much less money than many quarterbacks, whether the Giants will take Saquon Barkley and the Jets take Baker Mayfield, and whether the Rockets are this good or the Wolves are that bad."
986957151720554496,2018-04-19 13:18:16,Did LeBron win the game and lose momentum going to Indy? We debate. @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1
986804132739563521,2018-04-19 03:10:13,"Looking forward to seeing LeShannon on tomorrow's Undisputed. He lost ANOTHER case of Diet Dew to me. Gave me Pacers and 8 points. See you tomorrow, Unc."
986799937592541185,2018-04-19 02:53:33,"I keep saying on Undisputed, Donovan Mitchell has a lot of Westbrook in him - just a supremely athletic terror attacking the rim."
986799302201638912,2018-04-19 02:51:02,"I guess it still boils down to this for the Thunder: In a tight game like that, Russell Westbrook has to forget being a point guard and DO IT HIMSELF."
986797896220557312,2018-04-19 02:45:26,So disappointed in the Thunder. Had shot after shot after SHOT to win that game. Missed 13 of last 14 3s. Melo HAS TO make one of those. Should've closed the deal after a 19-0 run. Blew it more than Utah won it.
986782089398763520,2018-04-19 01:42:38,Great emotional answer by LeBron getting hit cold with an immediate post-game question about the passing of coach Popovich's wife. That was LeBron at his greatest.
986781611218747392,2018-04-19 01:40:44,Pacers can't ask for much more than withstanding LeBron's 46-point onslaught and their best player having an open 3 to tie with 22 seconds left.
986775916054429696,2018-04-19 01:18:06,Thank you.
986774312613855232,2018-04-19 01:11:44,So now LeBron can just throw Lance to the floor and drive by him? Refs are going to make sure this series goes to Indy 1-1.
986773539100348421,2018-04-19 01:08:39,WHAT??? THAT WAS NOT A FLAGRANT ON SABONIS. HE EVEN TRIED TO HOLD LEBRON UP. PROTECT THE SUPERSTAR. SOMEWHERE MICHEAL JORDAN IS CHUCKLING.
986760061551808513,2018-04-19 00:15:06,"Dominating half by LeBron. Cavs made six more 3s than Pacers. But remember, Pacers got what they needed: a win at Cleveland. Could just fold in 2nd half. Or could come out firing without pressure ..."
986751284718923777,2018-04-18 23:40:13,Pacers won the 1st quarter of Game 1 33-14. LeBron won the 1st quarter of Game 2 33-18. He played every minute of both 1st quarters. No idea why Oladipo sat for most of this one.
986745327058219012,2018-04-18 23:16:33,"Now let's see if Iron Man LeBron, after 15 seasons and playing the most minutes in the NBA this season, can sustain THIS energy for 40-something minutes. He ran out of gas in the 2nd quarter of Game 1."
986744500902027267,2018-04-18 23:13:16,"Good start for LeBron, being AGGRESSIVE ... as he should've been last Sunday, the worst plus-minus first quarter of his playoff career, -19."

986076320487518208,2018-04-17 02:58:09,"Tonight was just what the doctor (J) ordered for the Sixers. Just what they needed. Well, along with Joel Embiid."
986076019105775617,2018-04-17 02:56:58,It has been a long time since I've seen a team play as hard and physically on defense as the Heat did tonight. And it has been a long time since I've seen a team force up more bad shots than the Sixers did.
986075530607804416,2018-04-17 02:55:01,"You don't think the Cavs could use DWade right now? And LeBron had no problem with letting him go back ""home"" to Miami? DWade just stopped the final Sixers run single-handedly."
986053826904932352,2018-04-17 01:28:46,Philly goes from crazy hot to crazy cold from 3 (2-18 in the 1st half) while dwade turns back into DWADE (21 points) and Miami is doing a Sixers on the Sixers. LeBron will miss DWade in these playoffs.
985973518033547264,2018-04-16 20:09:39,Ty Lue said exactly what I said early today on Undisputed: LeBron MUST be more aggressive in the first quarter and set the tone for his new teammates. 0-4 in the 1st and trailing 33-14 will not work against THIS Pacers team. Lance set more of a tone yesterday than LeBron.

985870530560516096,2018-04-16 13:20:25,"First up on today's @undisputed: How much trouble is LeBron's team in? Then at 10 AM ET: Our reaction to Dez saying the ""Garrett guys"" got him."
985684392310747136,2018-04-16 01:00:46,"Now we await injury reports on Paul George, Adams and Donovan Mitchell. I still say the best by far of all first-round match-ups will bump and grind all the way to OKC beating Utah in Game 7 in the Thunderdome."
985683632869142528,2018-04-16 00:57:45,"Huge game from Paul George carries OKC in Game 1. He's better as Russ's lower-pressure sidekick, while Oladipo is better as The Man in Indy (plus Sabonis). Great trade for both teams."
985644006322323458,2018-04-15 22:20:18,"Yes, Cavs live/die by the 3 and made only 8-34. LeBron was 0-4 and didn't get much help from the newcomers, who probably pressed on the King's playoff stage. But today was about INDIANA. Advantage, Pacers."
985641828031512576,2018-04-15 22:11:38,"Can't wait to hear LeBron say, ""This is just what we needed."" And it just might be."
985639297024847877,2018-04-15 22:01:35,Pacers are now in position to overcome Cleveland's starting eight ... including the refs.
985638932023930880,2018-04-15 22:00:08,Funny how LeBron had very few triple doubles in his first 13 years until he saw what a big deal the media was making of Westbrook's trip-dubs starting two years ago.
985638466770759680,2018-04-15 21:58:17,LeBron clearly hacked Myles Turner -- NO CALL? Refs are doing everything in their power to help LeBron avoid Game 1 home upset.
985632952141819904,2018-04-15 21:36:22,"All Lance can do vs LeBron is talk junk to him, hard-foul him, try to get under his skin, in his head. Sometimes it works. Mostly it does not. But at least Lance ain't afraid of no King."
985632394953637889,2018-04-15 21:34:09,"Big 3rd quarter from LeBron and Co. cuts it to 8. The King should close this deal fairly easily. Refs will give him every break vs Lance, who's four inches shorter than LeKing."
985622471695986688,2018-04-15 20:54:43,"The Pacers are mentally tougher without George Paul as their No.-1-option ""superstar."" Refs gave LeBron and Co. EVERY CALL and the Pacers still lead by 17 at half. This is no fluke, no joke. LeBron now better say, ""I'M KING."""
985612820979924992,2018-04-15 20:16:22,"LeBron went ZeroDarkThirty in the first quarter, didn't make a single field goal, played all 12 minutes. Cavs trail 33 to only 14. 14??? Get it in gear, King. Whatever it takes. Strive for greatness."
985328282928168960,2018-04-15 01:25:43,Ben Simmons is going to have to take over this game if the Sixers are going to avoid a Game 1 upset without Embiid.
985269479796953088,2018-04-14 21:32:04,"I still say the Spurs will win Games 3 and 4, in San Antonio. But that is all. Warriors in 6."
985261903453679616,2018-04-14 21:01:57,"This is so different than Game1 last year at Oracle when the Spurs led by 23 mid 3rd quarter. Zaza Pacheapshot happened. With a healthy Kawhi, Spurs would've won last year's championship. With a happy Kawhi they would've won this year's championship."
985255403972837376,2018-04-14 20:36:08,"Why do people let Popovich get away with such classless, condescending nonanswers to reporters' legitimate questions?"
985254347310120961,2018-04-14 20:31:56,Doubtful the Spurs could get equal value in return if they trade Kawhi but it seems he's leaving them little choice. RC Buford pulled off all-time steal for Kawhi (George Hill for that 15th pick). Maybe RC can pull off steal of a trade deal for him.
985252293300830208,2018-04-14 20:23:46,"AGAIN: Kawhi Leonard quit on the Spurs, crumbled under the pressure to live up to MVP and Face of Franchise expectations. The most conservative/patient med staff in sports, the Spurs', cleared him to play 2 MONTHS AGO! Has a thigh bruise! Making 19 mil! Left team. Won't talk."
985249683093139456,2018-04-14 20:13:24,Reigning Finals MVP Kevin Durant (16/6/5 in the 1st half) is still the Best Player on the Planet.

Now nearly were NBA's best home team - fans root for 'em like Manu-led underdogs. But were the worst of playoff road teams. Can't see 'em winning at Oracle."
985228910668361734,2018-04-14 18:50:51,"Yesterday on Undisputed, ex-NBA coach Earl Watson picked the Spurs to upset the Warriors. I love the Spurs but I can't see it. These Spurs overachieved without Kawhi. Dubs underachieved without Steph. KD&gt;LA. Warriors in 6. Hope I'm wrong."
984894181549080576,2018-04-13 20:40:45,"Call me crazy. Call it heart over head. I say Thunder over Sixers for the NBA title. Russ takes over the playoffs and beats Utah in 7, Houston in 6 GSt in 7 and Philly in 6. Russ's Revenge."

984260147789754368,2018-04-12 02:41:20,LeBron finally played all 82 games for the first time in his 15 seasons. Or did he? Did tonight's cameo really count? Trivia note: Michael Jordan played all 82 games NINE TIMES.
984257826850619392,2018-04-12 02:32:07,"Yep: Game 7 of potential Cavs-Sixers will be played in Philly. If Embiid has come back strong by then, I like the home team's chances."
984250908274905088,2018-04-12 02:04:37,"Happy that Russell Westbrook unleashed earlier today on those who accuse him of stat-stuffing by ""stealing cheap"" rebounds.

983894789790707712,2018-04-11 02:29:32,"Loved Donovan Mitchell's sweatshirt definition of ""rookie."" As I said on today's Undisputed, I AGREE. Not only should BenSimmons be disqualified, but Mitchell has done more to lift his team in the W than Simmons has for a much better team in the E. Donovan Mitchell is ROY."

983118991752245248,2018-04-08 23:06:47,"Tiger finished tied for 32nd at 1 over par, 16 back of the winner. But Sunday's 3-under 69 will probably make him an early betting favorite to win the US Open. We want Ti-ger, we want Ti-ger ..."
983117429503967233,2018-04-08 23:00:35,"Patrick Reed has some of Tiger's old brazen mental toughness. He doesn't have Spieth's or Rory's or even Rickie's all-around game but when the stakes are highest, Reed's intangibles are stronger than theirs."
983114486360948736,2018-04-08 22:48:53,"I covered my 1st Masters in 1979 and I can't remember a player making more clutch putts than Patrick Reed just KEPT MAKING all the way home, including a highly missable 5-footer at 17 and easily choke-able 3-footer to win. Didn't hit the ball well enough to win. Putter won it."
983100017454891008,2018-04-08 21:51:23,"Jordan Spieth, the most confidently underconfident major winner ever, rolled all the way to 18 tee ... where he yanked it into the trees and well might have blown another Masters."
983095832827146240,2018-04-08 21:34:46,"Sometimes the golf gods bless the Masters winner with one impossible break - Fred Couples, Sergio last year ... maybe Patrick Reed just now hanging up in the bank at 13. But Spieth will be tough to out-birdie."
983084593044635649,2018-04-08 20:50:06,"Spieth, after birdie at his nemesis 12 and shot-of-the-tournament off pine straw to 13, has a real shot of catching Patrick Reed, who has been losing his driver left and right and does not look in charge. Spieth got a break today playing with best buddy Justin Thomas."
982823782535458829,2018-04-08 03:33:44,"Manu Ginobili just tied Michael Jordan for most double-digit scoring games (29) at age 40. Sorry, LeBron, you're only 33."
982819848827777026,2018-04-08 03:18:06,"MANUUUUUUUUUU: Ginobili does it again at age 40, takes over crucial game in 4th quarter vs hot-shooting Damian Lillard and Co. Bradyesque. Still Spurs' closer. My 6th Man of the Year."
982753801340764160,2018-04-07 22:55:39,"This will be a fascinating head-to-head shootout tomorrow between Patrick Reed and Rory McIlroy. YET: McIlroy just told CBS that all the pressure will be on Reed. Uh, no, Rory, it will be on you starting on No. 10, where you collapsed eight years ago."
982751412000927744,2018-04-07 22:46:09,"Oh, the irony: The player most of us were rooting for - Tiger now amazingly beloved - has been a major Masters disappointment. Maybe the least liked player on Tour - Patrick Reed - leads by 3 after 3 rounds."
982433802193485824,2018-04-07 01:44:05,"Terrific Cavs rally from 30 down, led by LeBron in attack mode. But Sixers without their best player really showed me some late-game guts and toughness, led by Ben Simmons and JJ Redick. Big psychological win for an arriving team."
982433006542503936,2018-04-07 01:40:56,LeBron just experienced his worst nightmare: alone at the free-throw line needing to make THREE to tie. Made the first but predictably gagged the second. Such a shaky late-game free-throw shooter. Had to intentionally miss the third.
982410595143114752,2018-04-07 00:11:52,Sixers are one team that ain't afraid of no King.
982410417413730304,2018-04-07 00:11:10,"What??? The Cavs just gave up 78 in the first half in Philly??? Such a poor defensive team now that LeBron no longer cares about playing D. If the Cavs have to deal with the Sixers in the playoffs WITH EMBIID, look out."
982397045532053505,2018-04-06 23:18:02,"My man Shannon Sharpe bet me a case of Diet Dew that Tiger would lead the Masters after today. Hated to take it, didn't want to root against Tiger. But he just finished 13 back, tied for 40th. Close."
982387959763681280,2018-04-06 22:41:56,"I figure Conor-Floyd II could be the last fight of each man's career. Floyd made $300 mil, Conor $100 mil for the 1st. An Octagon rematch easily could double that. Would Floyd ""get his"" under MMA rules?! Here are 2 great showmen who inspire extreme love/hate. Who wouldn't watch?"
982384706925690881,2018-04-06 22:29:00,"Do you really believe ConorMcGregor flew 7 hours to defend a teammate who merely traded insults with a rival at the hotel? No, Conor wanted to put on a show, remind everyone what a street-brawling ""hooligan"" he is. It worked! Won't hurt ticket sales that he got arrested."
982383456406552577,2018-04-06 22:24:02,It was pretty obvious yesterday was a publicity stunt that went a little too far for Conor McGregor.

982085415426375680,2018-04-06 02:39:43,I ask again: LeBron helped power the Cavs back into this game by attacking the basket in the 4th quarter and playing bully ball. Why didn't he do that all game long??? Indefensible. Unstoppable.
982084735169003520,2018-04-06 02:37:01,"John Wall, just back from injury, played the Wizards back into this game then played them right out of it in the last two minutes, letting LeBron off the hook for two more late missed free throws and a missed 3."
982075919803154432,2018-04-06 02:02:00,"Finally, some help for Tom Brady: Belichick signs Jordan Matthews of Vanderbilt University who set the all-time SEC record for catches and receiving yards. Has had drop and injury issues in Philly &amp; Buffalo but he's big and fast. Congrats, JM."

981983745291898881,2018-04-05 19:55:43,"This has always driven me nuts about Tiger: His golf IQ is equal to LeBron's highest basketball IQ, but Tiger has never figured out how to consistently drive the ball in the fairway. NEVER. Today missed fore, right! Made his rep with his length ... not his accuracy."
981981960024219648,2018-04-05 19:48:38,"Tiger plays a so-so opening Masters round, 1-over 73. Not out of it or yet in it. Drove it poorly, putted beautifully. No birdies on the par 5s like making four bogeys. But looked far more sure of himself than he has for a long while at majors."

978060801566126081,2018-03-26 00:07:21,Congrats to Bill Self and Kansas. Not a great KU team but Mykhailiuk made a huge clutch 3 late in regulation and (without Azubuike) Malik Newman just took over in overtime. Self is a good guy who has had more than his share of NCAA flameouts but he just beat K to get to the F4.
978059016524857345,2018-03-26 00:00:15,Grayson Allen had a lousy shooting day but nearly won it for Duke with 4 late free throws in regulation and a buzzer jumper off the glass that very nearly fell. Still think he can be an NBA contributor.

977735151579906048,2018-03-25 02:33:20,Either Lonzo is going to learn to shoot 3s conventionally or free throws sideways like his 3s. Can't switch to conventional for free throws and maintain any confidence. Now he gets afraid to drive because he dreads the free-throw line. Too special to have this flaw.
977733449904619523,2018-03-25 02:26:34,"Lonzo nearly has triple double (12/10/8) but remains in nightmarish shooting slump. 1-6 from 3, 1-4 from free-throw line including 2 late misses when fouled intentionally. FTs are the worst problem. Shoots 'em flat, no follow-through/touch/confidence."

977008350683586560,2018-03-23 02:25:17,"Lonzo's shot was gonzo again tonight. After a crazy hot streak for 16 games he's back in a nightmarish slump. 1-12 from 3. Hey, at least he wasn't afraid to keep shooting. Led all rebounders (even AD) w 13. 9 assists. But he's got to drive more and score."

976613134235398144,2018-03-22 00:14:50,"On Undisputed, I keep bringing up Fred VanVleet because he's bringing a new crucial off-the-bench mental toughness and fearlessness Toronto has not had. Led all scorers in the first half with 14 points on 4-5 threes. Wasn't sure he could play (bruised hand). Bruised LBJ's pride."
976611916821905408,2018-03-22 00:10:00,"What is LeBron DOING??? Not only did his team just give up 79 points in the first half, Toronto's biggest half of the season, but on the final play LeBron didn't even TRY to guard his man VanVleet, who nailed ANOTHER 3. You're better than that, King."

974813299710685184,2018-03-17 01:02:56,LeBron is a great athlete who was flying full speed at the rim. Nurkic can't jump. WHAT DID YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN? What did. At least Nurkic had the guts to try to contest. Recently LeBron just stood under the rim &amp; watched Ben Simmons fly down the lane and dunk. Avoided poster.
974811955243319296,2018-03-17 00:57:35,My longtime NBA pet peeve is the glorification of the full-speed dunk over a defender standing flat-footed under the rim. Not a fair fight. What often happens is WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. The defender has no chance and gets dunked on. For that he loses his manhood??? Absurd.

It has been only about nine months since he was arrested for driving impaired on various painkillers.
972950900032466944,2018-03-11 21:42:25,I'll say this again: The same Tiger Woods who hasn't won a major championship in going on 10 years is still times 10 the biggest draw in golf and rivals LeBron for the biggest individual draw in sports.

970122081407873024,2018-03-04 02:21:42,Cavs have lost the last 18 games in which they have trailed going to the 4th quarter. Surely the Best Player on the Planet can snap that shocking streak against a Denver team playing back to back on the road and 3 of last 5 nights.
970114317394653184,2018-03-04 01:50:51,Still no D in Clevelan. Gave up 73 to a tired Denver in 1st half. And I never thought I'd say that LeBron's Team goes as Rodney Hood goes. He went 1-6 and they trail by 11.
970001561890910209,2018-03-03 18:22:48,"The greatest play of LeBron's career was his last-second, no-time-to-think catch-and-shoot buzzer beater on Hedo off in-bounds from Mo that momentarily saved the Orlando series in Game 2 in Cleveland.

Tell me I'm wrong."
969998615958597632,2018-03-03 18:11:06,"So LeBron readily admitted he didn't intend to dribble behind his back and through TT's legs - pure luck, easily could've been another turnover, off TT's leg or foot. Then he posted that ""haters will say it's fake."" HUH?! No, King, YOU said it was fake."
969995900058677248,2018-03-03 18:00:18,"Baker Mayfield ran predictable 4.8. But he is the most pocket elusive of all the QBs. Most accurate. Least turnover prone.

967890015840739328,2018-02-25 22:32:16,"Once more: If the Spurs organization, most patient in sports with injuries, says Kawhi Leonard should be playing, he should be. He has a problem with a medical/training staff that has healed dozens of injuries over a dynasty? I have a problem with that."
967889163646205954,2018-02-25 22:28:53,"No Kawhi. No Manu. LeBron should put this game in his back pocket, starting now."

967603206216806401,2018-02-25 03:32:36,Laker fans: Are you SURE George Paul would change your life? I'm not.
967597889621864449,2018-02-25 03:11:28,Never thought I'd say this. But Russell Westbrook is passing too much.
967590827932315648,2018-02-25 02:43:25,"Come on, Paul George. You turned back into George Paul. 0-9! 0-5 from 3. Russ needs a little help! (He's 2 for10.)"
967589803117051904,2018-02-25 02:39:20,"Come on, Draymond asked for and got a deserved technical."

967575853088497665,2018-02-25 01:43:54,I'm rooting for Russ tonight but this will be tough as 10-point dogs at GSt vs a KD team the Thunder have punished twice already this season.
967243742007640066,2018-02-24 03:44:13,I greatly respect LeBron for playing back-to-back at Memphis tonight. I still think he plays too many minutes per game in part to build stats. But he takes his responsibility seriously as The Face of the NBA and he's on pace to play all 82 games. Much appreciated.

966887914897469443,2018-02-23 04:10:17,Steph Curry just hit an unbelievable shot (even for him) - a near-half-courter with just a flick of the wrist after dribbling free of three defenders as the first-quarter clock ran out.
966879515795275777,2018-02-23 03:36:54,"Silly me, I thought the New Cavs would blow out the Wall-less Wizards. Nope, still no D in Clevelan."

966860031936229376,2018-02-23 02:19:29,"Just when I thought it was safe to trust the New Cavs, they played defense like the Old Cavs in the 2nd quarter and got run off their own floor 35-23, trail by 3 at half. Again, Bron, you're playing down to your level of competition."
966758787720736768,2018-02-22 19:37:11,I'm only left to start wondering if Kawhi Leonard really was built to become the new leader of the San Antonio Spurs. Was the pressure too much? Was he just too injury prone? Would he be more comfortable as a co-star? Maybe.
966758075049820160,2018-02-22 19:34:21,"Some in Spurs organization believe Kawhi can ultimately be even more valuable than TimDuncan was. Yet he has become the first Spurs star to ever want OUT. If he can't get over the trust he has lost in them, Spurs ultimately be forced to trade him. Mind blowing. More his fault."
966756710177124352,2018-02-22 19:28:55,"I've talked to insiders on both sides of Kawhi vs the Spurs. As much as I love Kawhi, I'm on the Spurs' side. Just can't believe the NBA's best organization botched the rehab of a thigh contusion as badly as he believes. Now sounds like he's more mad than hurt. Bridge burning."

965397357255802881,2018-02-19 01:27:20,My wife Ernestine just asked why Kyrie couldn't have just said no when LeBron drafted him for his All-Star team. Now that's a good question.
965064017847840768,2018-02-18 03:22:46,"So far, Donovan Mitchell is rookie of the year and the biggest reason Utah will be a tough out in the Western Conference playoffs."
965063371262279686,2018-02-18 03:20:12,"I thought Donovan Mitchell deserved to win on his first final dunk, catching the ball way behind him and below his waist and pulling off a nasty throw-down."

965058984217477120,2018-02-18 03:02:46,Dennis Smith Jr. deserved 10s for that very complicated dunk. He's the best dunker in this competition.

965040643960487936,2018-02-18 01:49:53,I am rooting for Devin Booker to win this 3-point contest. But now he's not shooting in the Phoenix shadows.

963599586727141377,2018-02-14 02:23:38,Russell Westbrook doesn't look quite himself on the ankle that cost him the last two games. Zero rebounds so far. But watch him suck it up and shift into all-out attack mode in the 2nd half.
963598680254107648,2018-02-14 02:20:02,"First half at OKC: Rodney Hood, 3 threes. Jordan Clarkson, 4 assists. Larry Nance Jr., 2 blocks. Now, LeBron, you have more than enough help. Enjoy."
963582648856686592,2018-02-14 01:16:20,I agree with what Charles Haley said about the current Cowboys. They did not know what it took to sustain winning. They're losers until they learn the sacrifices required to win.
963581690672115712,2018-02-14 01:12:32,"You are about to watch the no-doubt, call-it-off Eastern Conference favorites led by comeback player of the year LeBron James and executive of the year Dan Gilbert."
963215110536798208,2018-02-13 00:55:52,Manziel now says he's bipolar. Maybe so. Maybe he did fall into substance abuse as a way to medicate himself. But he also loved being the life of the party more than he wanted to dedicate himself to being an NFL QB.
963214332325650432,2018-02-13 00:52:47,"Manziel doesn't know what he's talking about when he says he and Baker Mayfield ""are different people."" More similarities than differences.

962791705631010816,2018-02-11 20:53:25,My wife Ernestine and I are arguing about whether LeBron should've extended a hand to help up Kyrie. She says that was really nice of LeBron. I say Michael Jordan never helped up any opponent. But ... LeBron isn't made of MJ stuff.
962788245825241093,2018-02-11 20:39:40,Only now are people realizing just how valuable Kyrie is and was.

Full strength, THIS is the NBA's best/deepest team. You heard it here first."
962156840460083202,2018-02-10 02:50:41,"LeBron and his team predictably played revitalized tonight at Atl. Huge help is on the way. But no idea why LeBron needed to play 41 minutes in a blowout, except to get his triple double vs the NBA's worst team."
962076189882925057,2018-02-09 21:30:12,"You'd think LeBron would express some appreciation to Daniel Snyder for swallowing his pride, giving up on 2 players he traded for (I.T. and Crowder) and one he's close to (I.T.), hitting a trade-deadline walkoff shot and making LeBron's Team the best in the East."

961811994062987264,2018-02-09 04:00:23,"This would've been LeBron's worst nightmare: 3 free throws to TIE at Wash with 9 secs left. Of course, Kyrie hit all 3. Then got fouled on a 3 and hit all 3 in OT, then 2 more FTs. Celts win again. They're 40-16. LeBron still hasn't replaced Kyrie."

So he avoids driving and getting fouled in those situations. He's now 5 of 35 on last-second shots, 14%. Better than MJ? Please."
961775278396604416,2018-02-09 01:34:29,"In the 19 games before last night, LeBron James had the worst plus-minus of all 518 players in the NBA. The worst. So Dan Gilbert gutted the team and made it shockingly better in a single day. Your turn, LeBron."

961445959145111553,2018-02-08 03:45:54,It has been such a long time since LeBron hit a walk-off. Cannot wait to debate this game with LeShannon Sharpe tomorrow 9:30-noon E on FS1. See you then.
961445090148343808,2018-02-08 03:42:26,What a great Thursday-night-in-February NBA game that was.
961444670256513024,2018-02-08 03:40:46,"Told you. Way to go, LeBron. Just what your team needed from you."
961444387803643904,2018-02-08 03:39:39,That was just a dumb idea by Jimmy Butler and a gimme block by LeBron. This is a great spot for LeBron to hit a walk-off. No decision to make. Just catch and fire.
961443755990528000,2018-02-08 03:37:08,"THERE IT IS, LEBRON. THEY CANNOT STOP THAT. JUST DRIVE IT AND HAVE THE NERVE TO SHOOT THE FREE THROWS."
961443246999093248,2018-02-08 03:35:07,"After such a spectacular team shooting night, LeBron cannot let his team lose this game at home."
961440727707234304,2018-02-08 03:25:06,"NOOOOOOOOOOOO, LEBRON. DRIVE IT AND HAVE THE GUTS TO SHOOT THE FREE THROWS FOR THE WIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

961439642540060673,2018-02-08 03:20:48,LeBron needs to TAKE THIS GAME OVER NOW.
961432784211386369,2018-02-08 02:53:32,"LeBron actually started looking like LeBron again in the third quarter. Now he needs to sustain his energy and attack-mode through the fourth. His team needs him. Take 'em home at home, King."
961414423280680960,2018-02-08 01:40:35,"Bill Belichick looks more and more foolish for not playing Malcolm Butler. Obviously Belichick was trying to enhance his ""genius"" label by beating the Eagles w/ the corner, Eric Rowe, he had stolen from them when they gave up on Rowe. Backfired. Ungenius."

961089071589220352,2018-02-07 04:07:45,Tom Brady has to be FURIOUS with Bill Belichick.
961088849395904512,2018-02-07 04:06:52,"TOM BRADY PUBLICLY SUPPORTED MALCOLM BUTLER. In your face, Bill. Coach Belichick continues to get a pass for 1) giving up 41 points to a backup QB in the SBowl and 2) benching Malcolm Butler just because he wanted to play the ex-Eagle he traded for, Eric Rowe."
961068057895432192,2018-02-07 02:44:15,You can't tell me Josh McDaniels changing his mind about head-coaching Andrew Luck's team doesn't have something to do with thinking he will be Tom Brady's head coach sooner than later.
961067275527733248,2018-02-07 02:41:08,"Tonight Kyrie's Team doesn't look a whole lot better than LeBron's. But ""We Are the North"" is now thinking, ""We are the East."""
961063838828277762,2018-02-07 02:27:29,"LeBron is quitting on Dan Gilbert and the rest of the Cavs are quitting on LeBron. But underlying this free-fall is that LeBron is also starting to show his age, especially on defense. His free-agent or trade value is also declining."
961062996683272192,2018-02-07 02:24:08,"I have never seen anything like this. The Cavs still have ""The Best Player on the Planet."" They exploded for 43 in the 1st q at Orlando, led by 21. Then they scored 55 the rest of the way, including NINE in the 4th q. And lost by 18. To ORLANDO! LeWho?"

960351923688714240,2018-02-05 03:18:35,"No pass interference on Gronk???? Of course, no way they're going to call that."
960350893076983808,2018-02-05 03:14:30,How clutch was that.
960350496065114112,2018-02-05 03:12:55,Hogan has to catch that.
960350438280200193,2018-02-05 03:12:41,"A reverse to Rex Burkhead, who isn't exactly a speed demon???"
960350212261781505,2018-02-05 03:11:47,This does not feel like last year.
960350104526798848,2018-02-05 03:11:22,Terrific clutch kick by the Eagles' rookie.
960349951795511296,2018-02-05 03:10:45,* meant
960349781074706433,2018-02-05 03:10:04,It just feels like this is mean to be for the Eagles.
960349358121140224,2018-02-05 03:08:24,"If Philly wins, it took TWO wrong replay reviews that gave the Eagles TWO touchdowns they did not deserve to pull off this upset."
960348566681133056,2018-02-05 03:05:15,Keenan Allen said the other day on Undisputed that the baddest man on the Philly D is Brandon Graham. And he just proved it.
960348033765359616,2018-02-05 03:03:08,No Edelman. No Cooks.
960347745889402880,2018-02-05 03:01:59,"I'm fine with the spirit of that call. But by the letter of the current law, that was NOT A CATCH. No different than the Jesse James play at Pittsburgh."
960346523023294464,2018-02-05 02:57:08,NOT A CATCH.
960345948781101056,2018-02-05 02:54:51,Just one play.
960345266757844992,2018-02-05 02:52:08,This is unbelievably bad for a Belichick defense. No rush. Can't cover. At least give Malcolm Butler a shot.
960344345462194177,2018-02-05 02:48:28,Somebody on the Patriots D needs to help Brady by making JUST ONE PLAY. Just one.
960344065979006978,2018-02-05 02:47:22,Eagles flinched and false-started before that terrific thrown to Ertz. No call. No surprise.
960342207973638144,2018-02-05 02:39:59,When will Foles crack under Brady's onslaught?
960342095083986944,2018-02-05 02:39:32,Tom Brady has thrown for 457 yards and three touchdowns! 9:22 left! How lucky is Belichick to have Brady!
960341590525992961,2018-02-05 02:37:32,"Unbelievably, Tom Brady has thrown the Patriots back into the lead, despite the Eagles' 32 points."
960341317422235648,2018-02-05 02:36:27,That was an even better catch by Gronk than a throw by Brady.
960340287796035584,2018-02-05 02:32:21,Big Sky pass.
960336683433512960,2018-02-05 02:18:02,"Patriots need to force a turnover, NOW."
960336506152927232,2018-02-05 02:17:19,Carson who?
960336128829136898,2018-02-05 02:15:49,This is a hellacious good defense that Tom Brady is picking apart - and a hellacious deep pass rush he keeps overcoming.
960335679732441088,2018-02-05 02:14:02,You are watching Tom Brady do everything in his power to overcome a Belichick defense that is getting shredded by Nick Foles.
960335398797889536,2018-02-05 02:12:55,You are privileged to be watching THE GREATEST QUARTERBACK EVER giving us another all-time great performance on the biggest stage in American sports. Behold and savor.
960333935510081537,2018-02-05 02:07:07,The foot was out of bounds before he had complete control of the ball. Pats got hosed. No surprise.
960333605900709888,2018-02-05 02:05:48,Obviously the Patriots are generating no rush on Foles while Brady keeps getting battered.
960333330934714368,2018-02-05 02:04:42,"On the last replay I saw, it looked like maybe his foot was barely in bounds. Whatever, what a great throw by Nick Foles, who continues to go Brady on the playoffs. Belichick's halftime adjustments did not work."
960332173516537856,2018-02-05 02:00:06,Not sure he had control before he stepped out of bounds.
960331538247249920,2018-02-05 01:57:35,No way Carson Wentz would be doing THIS.
960331120653975552,2018-02-05 01:55:55,"Belichick's defense can't stop the run or the pass, and now Patrick Chung is hurt."
960330376093708289,2018-02-05 01:52:58,Where's Malcolm Butler???
960329059573014528,2018-02-05 01:47:44,Tom Brady has now thrown for 344 yards barely into the 3rd quarter!!!
960328714553737216,2018-02-05 01:46:22,THAT wasn't errant.
960328442997649409,2018-02-05 01:45:17,Was that errant???
960328274453741568,2018-02-05 01:44:37,No idea what Cris Collinsworth is talking about. Brady threw for 276 yards in the first half and Gronk dropped two and was interfered with on the 4th down throw. And Brady has thrown a bunch of errant passes???
960327468623081477,2018-02-05 01:41:25,I don't love the Patriots' chances. The Eagles are much more mentally tough than the Falcons were.
960326580768686080,2018-02-05 01:37:53,I had the privilege of seeing Prince live in 1985 during the Purple Rain Tour. All-time genius greatness.
960321988991401985,2018-02-05 01:19:38,Nick Foles caught his pass because it hit him right in the hands. Brady didn't catch his because it was an overthrow.
960320797280628736,2018-02-05 01:14:54,"One advantage Belichick has had at Super Bowls: the longer halftimes have allowed him more time to absorb what just happened and fix it. Your turn, Bill."
960320304231755777,2018-02-05 01:12:57,"Tom Brady, who so many people want to retire, just threw for 276 yards IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE SUPER BOWL. But his defensive genius head coach did not hold up his end of the bargain."
960318492867088384,2018-02-05 01:05:45,"Eagles just tricked the Patriots with THEIR version of a throw to the QB, this one right on target to a Foles who was recruited by Texas and Baylor to play basketball. Great gutsy call, going for the win, trying to knock out the champ."
960317113436012544,2018-02-05 01:00:16,Killer play. Patriots back in huge trouble. Belichick's defense becoming a Super Bowl embarrassment.
960315869715820544,2018-02-05 00:55:19,"I said all week on Undisputed and Facebook, Gostkowski has fought kicker demons all season, in and out of slumps. But I still trust him to make a game-winner."
960315381867937792,2018-02-05 00:53:23,"Here we go, Tom Brady, 90 yards in 7 plays. Back in the game, thanks to a fluke interception that just as easily could've set up a TD."
960314912961544192,2018-02-05 00:51:31,What a great throw from the MVP GOAT.
960314761140346882,2018-02-05 00:50:55,Too Gronk-centric.
960314335208902656,2018-02-05 00:49:13,GOOD CALL.
960314033906724864,2018-02-05 00:48:02,"CATCH THAT, GRONK."
960313818118111232,2018-02-05 00:47:10,Huge break for Brady. From very nearly GAME OVER to still alive. 22-6 would've been too much. These aren't the Falcons. Brady doesn't Edelman or Cooks.
960312514021015552,2018-02-05 00:41:59,"Patriots need to force a fumble, now."
960312330557956096,2018-02-05 00:41:16,I'm not sure Belichick's D can stop Nick Foles.
960311986562121728,2018-02-05 00:39:53,Brady is especially going to have a hard time scoring against this deep pass rush without Brandin Cooks threatening deep. Big trouble.
960311115535142913,2018-02-05 00:36:26,Assuming Malcolm Butler isn't playing because he was sick earlier in the week. But I don't know. Weird Belichick move? Maybe he'd better start playing now.
960310017441259522,2018-02-05 00:32:04,"Blount is going Blount on his ex-team. Where is the genius, Belichick???"
960309794694295552,2018-02-05 00:31:11,Alshon is going Plaxico on the Patriots.
960309028613062657,2018-02-05 00:28:08,I don't expect Brady to leave his feet for that pass. He's going to take enough punishment in this game and he's obviously not a receiver. That throw was just a little long.
960308612995231744,2018-02-05 00:26:29,That looked like pass interference. But Gronk is like Shaq. Refs let defenders get away with taking all kind of shots at him.
960307647869173761,2018-02-05 00:22:39,No Edelman. No Martellus. No Malcolm Mitchell. Now no Cooks???
960307257480159233,2018-02-05 00:21:06,"Here we go again: now Brady could be down ANOTHER receiver, his fastest one. Unreal."
960306312989954048,2018-02-05 00:17:21,"Ertz, who's very good, should've caught that pass. Pats caught a break."
960306087986585600,2018-02-05 00:16:27,"in the Pro Football Focus ranking of all 106 SBowl players, Pats' punter, kicker and snapper ranked in the bottom 7 players."
960305371079262208,2018-02-05 00:13:36,LET BRADY THROW IT ON THIRD DOWN. QUIT TRYING TO TRICK 'EM WITH JET SWEEPS. FOLLOWED BY A MOMENTUM-KILLING MISSED CHIP SHOT FG.

960301847239041029,2018-02-04 23:59:36,"Belichick, where is your defense???"
960301064657412097,2018-02-04 23:56:30,Both QBs had so much success in their opening drives that it suggests a higher scoring game. We'll see.
960300653867233281,2018-02-04 23:54:52,This is exactly what I don't like about having Gronk healthy: Brady forces too many throws to him in tight congested coverage. I like the NE offense even better when Brady is spreading the ball to receivers you least expect. 3-3.
960298420089925632,2018-02-04 23:45:59,I hope the Patriots go no-huddle and play fast the way Eli did vs the Eagles. But that of course requires making first downs.
960297636208132097,2018-02-04 23:42:52,"I know the Patriots have never scored in the first quarter of a Super Bowl, but it always infuriates me when Belichick wins the toss and takes the ball out of Brady's hands. But at least the D bent and bent and didn't quite break. Just 3-0."
960296793794736128,2018-02-04 23:39:31,This feels like Jacksonville all over. Where's Belichick's defense?
960296471290499072,2018-02-04 23:38:14,"I said all week on Undisputed that Foles would NOT turn into Folds, that he has been better in the playoffs than Wentz would've been. He torched Vikes' No. 1 D. He's at it again."

960292597410406400,2018-02-04 23:22:51,What scares me the most about the Eagles is they're much deeper in pass rushers than the Seahawks and Falcons were in the last two Brady Super Bowls - and less likely to tire in the 4th quarter.
960292262822387712,2018-02-04 23:21:31,Would I be shocked if this becomes Belichick's last game as Patriots coach? Nope.
960292060552093696,2018-02-04 23:20:43,"Gut feeling: It will take every bit of Brady's late-game greatness to pull this out. Hope I'm wrong. Hope it's much easier than that. But I respect and fear these ""underdog"" Eagles too much. 20-17 Patriots."

959987323986325504,2018-02-04 03:09:48,"Congratulations to Tom Brady for winning a 3rd MVP he obviously deserved, overcoming a defense that finished 31st in efficiency ... without Edelman. But you know and I know that all he cares about is winning tomorrow's game."
959977550591139841,2018-02-04 02:30:58,"I agree with Mark Jackson: If LeBron is the Best Player on the Planet, HE has to find a way to ignite his team on defense and spark the team on offense. He just isn't playing that hard. Maybe he has given up on Dan Gilbert and is just waiting till next year."
959973732402933760,2018-02-04 02:15:47,It is STUNNING how many layups and open 3s that LeBron's Team allows and how limited Isaiah Thomas looks coming off his hip injury - very little lateral or vertical quickness.
959962825706815488,2018-02-04 01:32:27,Congratulations to Ray Lewis. Never been a greater leader in any sport.
959962208707887104,2018-02-04 01:30:00,Congratulations to Terrell Owens. I am happy and relieved for him because I know how much this meant to him.

He conducted a 6th (80 yds, 12 plays, TD pass 2:42 left) before Tyree happened. But do you hear anyone talk about that? Greatest clutch player ever. No credit for it."
959527359777931264,2018-02-02 20:42:04,"Former Rams coach Mike Martz said today on Undisputed he heard Belichick had all of the Rams' SBowl 36 practices videotaped - but Martz didn't care bc he added nothing much new &amp; thought that gave NE no advantage.

958900951183601664,2018-02-01 03:12:56,Sure looked like LeBron hacked James Johnson on the arm as Johnson went up and under for that final shot attempt to tie at the buzzer. But James Johnson isn't going to get that call in the King's house.

958542402821636097,2018-01-31 03:28:12,Some game by James Harden - 1st 60-point triple double. But Orlando on Jan 30 is one thing ... San Antonio in a home Game 6 is quite another.

956660640541696000,2018-01-25 22:50:45,Amazing that Belichick's Pats have never scored in the 1st q of a SBowl and that all 7 Super Bowls have been pretty to extremely close. Maybe Brady toys with opponents for a while so he can pull off all-time comebacks.
956659358917566464,2018-01-25 22:45:39,Brady is a little better without Gronk.

956004695444606977,2018-01-24 03:24:15,"Don't think LeBron will take this loss all that hard, on 30,000 Night ... even though his team is a lifeless mess."
956004347585818624,2018-01-24 03:22:52,"I had no idea LeBron had become such a big brother and mentor to Dejounte Murray, the new Spurs starting point guard."
955997961997099010,2018-01-24 02:57:30,"Remember, the Spurs are playing without the best 2-way player in the NBA (Kawhi), their 2nd best athlete (Rudy Gay), the Sxith Man of the Yer (Manu) and with a Tony Parker who lost his starting job because he's still not fully healthy after rupturing his quad."
955977141799268352,2018-01-24 01:34:46,"Too bad the best two-way player in basketball couldn't have been guarding LeBron when he topped 30,000 points. Get well soon, Kawhi."
955976617234374656,2018-01-24 01:32:41,"Congratulations, LeBron."
955973575541796865,2018-01-24 01:20:36,"More impressive, LeBron about to go over 30,000 points for his career or Tom Brady, very possibly topping 10,000 postseason passing yards in the upcoming Super Bowl? Next is Peyton Manning with 7,339."
955932688933728256,2018-01-23 22:38:08,"Uh, coach Belichick: When your QB needs 12 stitches at the base of his thumb 3 days before facing Sacksonville in the AFC title game, THAT QUALIFIES AS A FOOTBALL CRISIS. You know full well the slightest hand injury could affect Brady's greatest strength: deadly accuracy w/ touch"
955931021614067713,2018-01-23 22:31:30,"Dueling radio shows: Belichick is obviously so concerned about Brady getting more credit than the coach for Sunday's comeback that he discounted Brady's hand injury on his radio show while Brady talked about how ""stressed out"" he was on HIS radio show. This is comically sad."
955929502760165376,2018-01-23 22:25:28,"Dear Skip: I want to be the first to congratulate you for congratulating old LeBron for publicly congratulating young LeBron for scoring his 30,000th point before he actually scores it!

955599753122791425,2018-01-23 00:35:09,"As a Cowboy fan, the Giants' hiring of Pat Shurmur barely gets a murmur out of me. No wow factor. No big threat. Eagles scare me. Not the Giants or Redskins."
955597464848949248,2018-01-23 00:26:04,Now we start finding out if Giannis is or isn't That Guy.
955596437630337024,2018-01-23 00:21:59,"Tom Brady: down 10 in 4th to Legion of Boom, down 16 in 4th to Falcons last year, down 10 in 4th yesterday. Great in late FG drives to win 1st two SBowls. Great late vs NYG until he got Tyreed. But always discounted &amp; discredited."
955595318824808449,2018-01-23 00:17:32,"The Eagles are better than the Pats in these areas: RBs, receiving corps, O line, front 7. front 4 pass rush. Nick Foles has completed an incredible 75% of his passes in 3 playoff games, 5 TDs, 0 INTs. But the Pats have the assassin in sheep's clothing ..."
955593735902961665,2018-01-23 00:11:15,"Brady's go-to guy is Amendola, undrafted because he's 5-11, 190 &amp; ran 4.7 at combine. Not Julio Jones. Not AB, Not Alshon. Danny Amendola. Talk about degree of difficulty."
955592902888968192,2018-01-23 00:07:56,"No Edelman, Martellus, Gronk. No run game (28 rush yards until that final burst by DLewis). Pats lost time of possession, turnover battle. Bortles threw for nearly 300, Jags ran for 100. And Brady threw for 138 in the 4th and pulled it out vs Jags D."
955591805621362688,2018-01-23 00:03:35,"So much Brady hate/jealousy/envy/resentment out there I never hear anyone say, ""What Tom Brady pulled off again yesterday in the fourth quarter was amazing."" It's grudging qualified praise at best. If this were any other superstar, it would be runaway idolatry."
955590696534097920,2018-01-22 23:59:10,As I've talked/tweeted about Kawhi's situation: Neither Spurs doctors/trainers nor outside surgeons/phystherapists can find anything wrong w/ his quad. But he says still feels pain. All-time weird. Some trust issues developing. But team gave him space/time to heal on his own.

955279382045589505,2018-01-22 03:22:07,"Eagles are anywhere from 5.5 to 6.5 underdogs to Brady and Co. As much as I respect the Eagles, I'm surprised the spread isn't 7 or 8."
955268376699416576,2018-01-22 02:38:23,JOIN ME LIVE ON FACEBOOK AT THE END OF THE GAME FOR EARLY GUT FEELING ON BRADY VS EAGLES.
955263240702803968,2018-01-22 02:17:59,"It's about time for Doug Pederson to put Nick Foles on Super Bowl ice. That's enough for him, Doug. Brady awaits."
955257846387458048,2018-01-22 01:56:33,"Through 3 quarters, Mike Zimmer's vaunted defense has allowed 403 yards to Nick Foles' offense, which is 8 of 10 on 3rd down."
955256760352124928,2018-01-22 01:52:14,"As I said all week on Undisputed, it was a JOKE that the Eagles were home underdogs to the Vikings in the NFC Championship Game."
955255352597012480,2018-01-22 01:46:38,Random thought: I guarantee Jalen Ramsey will not be playing in the Super Bowl.
955255001915338753,2018-01-22 01:45:14,What has happened to the Vikings so far has not been Case Keenum's fault.
955254806829912064,2018-01-22 01:44:28,"Feel for you, Viking fans: from all-time stunned elation to so-near, so-far deflation."
955251199560753152,2018-01-22 01:30:08,"Nick Wentz, Carson Foles. Six of one, half of the other. Eagles are still the Eagles."
955243870396194816,2018-01-22 01:01:00,"The Eagles mde Wentz look better than he was, not vice versa. Wentz, Foles, doesn't make much difference. The Eagles are a very good football team- O line, run game, receivers, defense. Wentz ws NOT the MVP. Brady was."
955238929740869632,2018-01-22 00:41:22,"TOMORROW ON UNDISPUTED, I WILL MAKE THE CASE THAT TOM BRADY, THE ASSASSIN IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING, HAS PROVEN EVEN MORE CLUTCH THAN MICHAEL JORDAN ... AND THAT BRADY AT 40 IS PLAYING AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN LEBRON AT 33."
955238265115762688,2018-01-22 00:38:44,"ON TOMORROW'S UNDISPUTED, SNOOP DOGG AGAIN JOINS US TO TALK BRADY, LAVAR/LONZO/LAKERS, LEBRON. DO NOT MISS."
955235640446038016,2018-01-22 00:28:18,Tom Brady sure could've used LeGarrette today. The Pats managed 46 yards rushing and Brady still threw for 138 in the 4th quarter and pulled it off.
955230366758928384,2018-01-22 00:07:21,"Howie Long's son strikes again, raking Keenum's arm, helping cause what turned into a poor-tackling Pick Six. Just what the Eagles needed."
955226343473475584,2018-01-21 23:51:22,"Undrafted journeyman Case Keenum is making himself a whole lot of money, via franchise tag or maybe free agency."
955225801665871873,2018-01-21 23:49:13,"In honor of the upcoming Winter Olympics, the Vikings just did a curling celebration. Loved it."

955215086129311744,2018-01-21 23:06:38,"HAS TOM BRADY EVER BEEN GREATER, EVEN AT 40????"
955215002713010176,2018-01-21 23:06:18,This is why Belichick was forced to trade Jimmy G.
955214865970339840,2018-01-21 23:05:45,I just got goosebumps.
955214214309625856,2018-01-21 23:03:10,Stephon Gilmore just earned his free-agent salary.
955212808844492800,2018-01-21 22:57:35,NO PASS RUSH. MUST BLITZ.
955212572461907969,2018-01-21 22:56:38,Where's Tyree? Manningham. Here comes Eli Bortles.
955211860835409920,2018-01-21 22:53:49,WHAT A THROW AND WHAT A CATCH BY THE CLUTCHEST PATRIOT RECEIVER DANNY AMENDOLA.
955211087279869952,2018-01-21 22:50:44,"Tom Brady, greatest QB sneaker ever."
955209734356795393,2018-01-21 22:45:22,Can the Patriots do what they usually don't - take the ball away?
955209597865705472,2018-01-21 22:44:49,James White has to catch that.
955209047069794305,2018-01-21 22:42:38,"Talk about THAT, Jalen."
955208788109246464,2018-01-21 22:41:36,"I knew Jags offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett when he was 4 or 5 years old and his father Paul was coaching Joe Montana. Couldn't have imagined Nathaniel would one day match wits with a QB even better than Montana, in an AFC title game."
955207523107139584,2018-01-21 22:36:35,Eli Bortles strikes again.
955206375423934464,2018-01-21 22:32:01,"You just watched The Greatest QB Ever pull off yet another great drive, this one against the Sacksonville defense."
955205671523250176,2018-01-21 22:29:13,"Gutsy call, another flea flicker."
955204711262515200,2018-01-21 22:25:24,"Time of possession: Jax 31 minutes, Brady 17 minutes. Jax 20, Brady 10."
955203956027740160,2018-01-21 22:22:24,"Still, big-time play by Myles Jack off a crazy trick play pulled off by the Patriots, out of desperation."
955203673625321472,2018-01-21 22:21:17,WRONG. HE REGAINED CONTROL WHEN HIS KNEE TOUCHED.
955203327175811073,2018-01-21 22:19:54,Dion Lewis had control when his knee touched.
955202887252041728,2018-01-21 22:18:09,Patriots haven't been able to run an inch on this defense. Makes it even TOUGHER ON BRADY.
955202216196894720,2018-01-21 22:15:29,Jacksonville just took a 10-point lead.
955201495103778816,2018-01-21 22:12:37,David vs Goliath? Which one's David?
955201294179778560,2018-01-21 22:11:49,Belichick is failing to hold up his end of the bargain with Brady.
955200872337702912,2018-01-21 22:10:09,ZERO PRESSURE ON ELI BORTLES.
955200753655672832,2018-01-21 22:09:41,"This is about to be the game, one way or the other."
955200432938233856,2018-01-21 22:08:24,"Here we go again. They let Fournette escape, then convert 3rd down AGAIN."
955198923425038336,2018-01-21 22:02:24,"Finally, Belichick's defense made something happen with the Chung blitz. Finally Brady has some room to operate, even without Gronk."
955197844104925185,2018-01-21 21:58:07,Right now it's not Tom vs Time. It's Tom vs Tom (Coughlin).
955196955977662464,2018-01-21 21:54:35,NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
955196628721221637,2018-01-21 21:53:17,Pass inteference. Held his hand down.
955195736244695040,2018-01-21 21:49:44,Good news: Pats finally stopped Bortles. Bad news: Josh Lambo has a strong accurate leg under pressure.
955194126277857280,2018-01-21 21:43:21,Unbelievable throw. Eli Bortles.
955193550957830144,2018-01-21 21:41:03,AGAIN ZERO PASS RUSH FOR THE PATRIOTS.
955193436520431616,2018-01-21 21:40:36,"Doesn't sound good for Gronk to return. Not the end of the world for Brady, who now won't be so Gronkcentric. He'll spread the ball - if the defense can get him the ball."
955189215700008960,2018-01-21 21:23:50,I'M GOING LIVE ON FACEBOOK AS SOON AS THE HALF ENDS FOR A QUICK REACTION TO WHAT I SAW (AND DID NOT SEE) IN THE FIRST HALF.
955188940750831616,2018-01-21 21:22:44,"More James White in the second half. After all, he was very nearly Super Bowl MVP."
955188702963052546,2018-01-21 21:21:47,"That helmet-to-helmet on Gronk was probably worth it for the Jags, if Gronk is gone with a concussion. But Brady did win the Super Bowl without him for the last eight games last year."
955183348250324992,2018-01-21 21:00:31,Gronk drop.
955182136696356864,2018-01-21 20:55:42,"At this rate, the Jags are going to score another 45 points, this time at Belichick."
955181593349431296,2018-01-21 20:53:32,Belichick's bend-but-don't-break defense had better quit breaking.
955180838336909312,2018-01-21 20:50:32,"As I keep saying on Undisputed, Blake Bortles is far from ""trash."" He somehow became a punch line after having a pretty good season, including four 300+-yard games and 21 TD passes to 13 INTs. Now look at him."
955179166218907648,2018-01-21 20:43:54,That was obviously pass interference.
955178458216243200,2018-01-21 20:41:05,"I guess because nobody talked about the undrafted Corey Grant, the Patriots forgot about him and he gashed them twice on that drive."
955178069043458048,2018-01-21 20:39:32,I knew it: Blake Bortles is starting to look like Eli Manning as Brady takes on yet another Tom Coughlin team.
955175456952565760,2018-01-21 20:29:09,McDaniels tried to trick 'em with misdirection the last two plays. LET BRADY THROW IT.
955171858063663104,2018-01-21 20:14:51,That was a win for Jax - but a little bigger win for Brady. Throwing hand appears to be functioning fine.
955170901611315200,2018-01-21 20:11:03,What a throw.
955169687289053185,2018-01-21 20:06:14,"Jags win toss, kick, dare Brady and his stiched-up hand."
955169502991233025,2018-01-21 20:05:30,"Before he needed 10 stitches in his throwing hand, I had Brady by 10. Now I have him and his Patriots surviving by 3. He looked OK throwing before the game but I'm still not sure how snaps he can take under center. Advantage, Jags. Here we go."
954928688625197062,2018-01-21 04:08:35,"LeBron is starting to show some age, on defense and in second halves, and so is his team. Somebody will have to pay, probably Ty Lue. No strong vote of confidence from LeBron."
954927436117950467,2018-01-21 04:03:37,"Two stars who have too often come up small in the playoffs came up big vs the defending champs tonight in Houston. But as CP3 and James Harden just said, it's just Jan. 20. They both have much to prove in May."
954547096798900224,2018-01-20 02:52:17,"This isn't for Ice Cube's sake or his son's. ""Den of Thieves"" is WAY better than some of its lukewarm reviews, a powerfully told strongly acted heist chess game with a flip ending. Longish but never felt it. Spectacular shootouts &amp; tension. O'Shea Jr. plays key role. Thumbs up."
954449852355698688,2018-01-19 20:25:52,"In the second halves of the last 11 Cav games, LeBron is -61, worst of the 416 players in the NBA in that stretch."
954448607033229312,2018-01-19 20:20:55,"Shannon Sharpe picked the Eagles, making a strong case that they're a better overall football team than Minnesota. I agree. But that disqualifies his argument that Wentz was MVP. The Eagles made Wentz more than vice versa. Wentz, Foles, hasn't mattered."
954447747892965376,2018-01-19 20:17:30,"I was going to pick NE over Jax 27-14 until Brady suffered this practice accident. Now I'll stick with my preseason pick but barely. Patriots 17-14, winning more with their defense that must force two turnovers."
954447021179510784,2018-01-19 20:14:37,"Usually Brady says of his injuries, ""I'm fine."" He did not say that today. He said ""we'll see."" He did not seem all that confident he'll be able to play or to throw reasonably well. Once again: Advantage, Tom Coughlin's team."
954445839077789696,2018-01-19 20:09:55,My Undisputed debate partners say Patriots are faking or exaggerating Brady's injury. WHY? To make Jax prep for Brian Hoyer? To create an excuse for The Greatest QB Ever? HE MISSED CRUCIAL THURS FULL-PADS PRACTICE. THUMB IS CRUCIAL TO ACCURACY. HE'S OBVIOUSLY HURT TO SOME DEGREE.

953785095713824768,2018-01-18 00:24:21,Uh-oh: Tom Brady missed his interview session and was limited in practice with what the team listed as a throwing-hand injury. That's new. That's could be a big problem. The Tom Coughlin Hex strikes again?
953779628279123978,2018-01-18 00:02:38,"Amazing but predictable the NBA let Chris Paul off the hook with no suspension for his role (or lack of) in the Rockets' storming of the Clips' locker room. After all, he's the president of the Players Association."
953778216937734144,2018-01-17 23:57:01,It sure sounds like Roethlisberger would like to see Mike Tomlin gone as well as Todd Haley.

As Paul said, IT punked Ainge!"
953773232670175232,2018-01-17 23:37:13,"My, Myself and Isaiah. As in Thomas, LeBron's newest burden, who thinks he became a combination Bill Russell/Larry Bird as a Celtic for a mere 2 years and 21 games. The Hall of Fame Isiah Thomas was never this full of himself and he was twice the player the Cavs' Isaiah is."
953770881217478656,2018-01-17 23:27:52,"I'm leaning Eagles but will root for the Vikings. If Brady manages to get past Sacksonville, he would get far more Super Bowl credit for beating the Vikes' No. 1-ranked defense in its Thunder Dome than he would for beating Nick Foles at a neutral site."

953466445840592896,2018-01-17 03:18:09,"Celts lose in OT at home, mostly because ANTHONY DAVIS WAS JUST TOO UNSTOPPABLY GOOD. No idea why Pels are only 3 games over .500. Kyrie tied it late in regulation but missed a contested 3 to tie late in OT. Still, Celts are 34-11."

953359335207329792,2018-01-16 20:12:32,No way Cavs management can use its extra first-round pick from Brooklyn to get LeBron help via trade unless he helps the owner by committing to stay for at least two more years. Cavs can't trade away the future if LeBron isn't going to be part of it.
953358657646809088,2018-01-16 20:09:51,"I believe LeBron would be better served with Calderon at PG instead of shoot-first, no-D Isaiah Thomas."
953357750901211136,2018-01-16 20:06:15,"Austin Rivers earned the right to talk last night when he scored 36 in a 10-point Clips win at Houston Dec. 23rd. He's a tough young man who runs from nobody. If a Rocket had started something, he would finish it."

953113171476099072,2018-01-16 03:54:22,"Steph was just Globetrotter clowning the Cavs in the end, cupping the ball behind him as he eyed defenders, hooking no-look passes. It's his form of taunting."

952711840215150597,2018-01-15 01:19:37,I tried the same reverse Twitter jinx I used late in the first half of last year's Super Bowl against the Falcons. I declared this game over for the Vikings at 17-0. It almost worked. It SHOULD'VE worked.
952711485913939968,2018-01-15 01:18:13,"I'm with Case Keenum: I don't even know what just happened. But I am happy for him. Good guy, underrated QB. Soon will cash in on the money he has earned."

952707626025984001,2018-01-15 01:02:53,Do not count out Case Keenum.
952706435778883584,2018-01-15 00:58:09,Terrific sidearm throw by Brees beating the blitz. That was a catch.
952705880931295232,2018-01-15 00:55:57,What a clutch throw by Drew Brees.
952705674063917056,2018-01-15 00:55:07,Huge drop.
952703646986203136,2018-01-15 00:47:04,"Dangerous pass by Keenum, huge completion. That's Keenum."
952701922225504256,2018-01-15 00:40:13,"What a great design by mad scientist Sean Payton: getting Kamara on a linebacker. Nice throw, nice catch - pretty easy TD."
952700741084364800,2018-01-15 00:35:31,"That was pass interference - Saints finally got a break, followed by a punt block."
952698751805571072,2018-01-15 00:27:37,I liked the call by Sean Payton to let Snead (a high-school QB) make a trick-play throw to Kamara. Had him. Missed him long. Worth the shot.
952695725548175360,2018-01-15 00:15:35,Sean Payton is having a bad day.
952694816613150720,2018-01-15 00:11:59,Amazing Saints coaches had the best view in the house and Sean Payton challenged what is obviously a catch.
952691512575275009,2018-01-14 23:58:51,"Keenum has gotten away with throws like that a lot this season. That's who he is. But he didn't get away with that one, thanks to a monster rush by Cam Jordan."
952678892673712128,2018-01-14 23:08:42,"What a poor play by Drew Brees, taking the sack when HE KNEW HE HAD TO GET RID OF THE BALL TO P,RESERVE A MAKABLE FIELD GOAL."
952671440372822016,2018-01-14 22:39:05,"Once the Cowboys were eliminated, I picked the Saints to win the NFC and stuck with them after a shaky win at home over Cam. I was wrong. This game turned on the unchallenged wrong spot that should've been Saints ball."
952670928969715712,2018-01-14 22:37:03,"This game is, unfortunately, OVER. Congrats, Vikings. One game at Nick Foles away from a home Super Bowl."
952666947816103937,2018-01-14 22:21:14,Drew Brees at 38 needs a running start in the pocket to javelin-throw the deep ball. He tried to launch that one from a standstill. Way underthrown. Interception. Big trouble for the Saints.
952663588983861248,2018-01-14 22:07:53,"Drew Brees has looked shaky early. He's 1-4 in road playoff games having lost to Rex Grossman, Matt Hasselbeck and Alex Smith. I've always liked Case Keenum but this won't look good for Brees' legacy if he falls to 1-5. The win was over Foles in Philly."
952663112213123073,2018-01-14 22:06:00,That was obviously a terrible call on Crawley. Diggs fooled the ref into throwing a flag that could've been thrown on him.
952659126814834689,2018-01-14 21:50:10,Sean Payton cost his team that touchdown by not challenging that first-down spot.
952658650111209472,2018-01-14 21:48:16,CAN'T BELIEVE SEAN PAYTON DIDN'T CHALLENGE THAT. WAY SHORT OF THE FIRST-DOWN LINE. UNREAL. WOULD'VE CHANGED THE EARLY MOMENTUM. YOU COULD EVEN SEE IT ON THE LIVE VIEW. WHERE ARE HIS EEYES IN THE PRESSBOX???

952653452424888320,2018-01-14 21:27:37,"I said on Undisputed that Blake Bortles would play well enough to win this game and that the difference would be a Josh Lambo field goal in a tough place to kick. CONGRATS, BLAKE AND JOSH AND THE JAGS."
952649790751358976,2018-01-14 21:13:04,I WILL GO LIVE ON FACEBOOK SOON AFTER THIS GAME TO UNLOAD EARLY THOUGHTS ON THIS OUTCOME AND THIS WINNER AT TOM BRADY NEXT WEEK. JOIN ME.
952649519656615936,2018-01-14 21:11:59,"Just as everyone expected: Jags 42, Steelers 35 with 2 minutes left in the freezing cold. What a game."
952649083021287424,2018-01-14 21:10:15,Way too early - 2:18 left - to go onside. And they botched it.
952648221636968448,2018-01-14 21:06:50,This game has overtime written all over it.
952647557443829760,2018-01-14 21:04:11,That's the second time the Jags have gotten away with a big pass interference.
952647224307081216,2018-01-14 21:02:52,Stunned the Jags haven't gotten more pressure on Ben. He has often had more than enough time to throw. Sacksonville?
952645218129428480,2018-01-14 20:54:53,What a call by my friend Paul Hackett's son Nathaniel -- a TD pass to the lead-blocker fullback out of the I to put Jacksonville ahead by 14 with 4:09 left. JACKSONVILLE HAS SCORED 42 POINTS!
952643818754424832,2018-01-14 20:49:20,Bortles just did it AGAIN.
952643426289205248,2018-01-14 20:47:46,"If you'd told the Jags they'd be up 7 with nine minutes left with the ball, they'd have said, ""Great."" But this doesn't feel great."
952643140581703680,2018-01-14 20:46:38,"There are a lot of little guys who are as quick and fast as Antonio Brown, but NO ONE can get open and catch the way this little man consistently does on the biggest stages. What a football player."
952642723751735296,2018-01-14 20:44:59,"Bouye held Antonio's jersey the whole way down the field and ANTONIO STILL JUST WOULD NOT BE DENIED THE FOOTBALL. Heart, guts, backbone, clutch toughness ... you name. Antonio Brown has it."
952641911034032129,2018-01-14 20:41:45,Now this Jags D is going to be DEVASTATED FOR DAYS if Jacksonville loses a game in which it scored 35 points in the cold at Pittsburgh.
952641074039681024,2018-01-14 20:38:25,Still an eon of time left for Ben and Le'Veon and Antonio and Martavis and JuJu and ...
952640172876750848,2018-01-14 20:34:51,"Back to back huge clutch throws, one on 3rd and 8, the next deep, by ... Blake Bortles!"
952637596768841728,2018-01-14 20:24:36,Now I do not love the Jags chances of winning this game ... and this Jags defense is going to be SICK if the Jags blow a 21-0 lead without a turnover.
952636962355142657,2018-01-14 20:22:05,"If you told the Jags they'd be up 7 going to the 4th quarter, they'd have said, ""Great, we got this."" But the momentum so strongly belongs to Pittsburgh that this game feels tied already."
952631206075547648,2018-01-14 19:59:13,Ben is making some amazing throws to covered receivers for crucial comeback touchdowns.
952625263635873792,2018-01-14 19:35:36,"What a horrendous breakdown on 4th and 11 for the Jacksonville D. Tayshaun Gipson just WATCHED Martavis run right by him for a bomb TD. Just can't happen. Steelers are back in this, especially if Fournette can't go."
952622230772461568,2018-01-14 19:23:33,Jacksonville keeps slamming the door then re-opening up with the taunting penalty and botched kickoff.
952619597173174272,2018-01-14 19:13:05,The problem this coming-of-age Jags defense now faces is that it hasn't yet come of age. Very little playoff experience. At 21-0 it took its foot off the mental gas. Now can it re-establish its dominance over Ben's offense?
952618909353390080,2018-01-14 19:10:21,"One thing about Fournette: For all his athletic power, he has been fragile. If he's gone with a sprained ankle, Pittsburgh now has a chance to win this."
952617598750871552,2018-01-14 19:05:08,"Antonio Brown just wanted that ball more than A.J. Bouye did, so he fought free and one-handed it. Greatness."
952612357275926528,2018-01-14 18:44:19,"What a force Jalen Ramsey has become, as a big shut-down corner and a linebacker of a tackler."
952609647524945920,2018-01-14 18:33:33,",Roethlisberger said before the Bills-Jags playoff game, ""I want Jacksonville."" As I said on Undisputed, be careful what you wish for."
952604976156585984,2018-01-14 18:14:59,"What an athletic body-control power-dive by Leonard Fournette. What a here-to-win statement by Doug Marrone, going for 7 on 4th and goal from the 2 instead of playing not to lose by taking 3. What a start for Jacksonville."
952399735284891648,2018-01-14 04:39:26,I'M ABOUT TO GO LIVE ON FACEBOOK TO TALK BRADY-PATRIOTS AND JAGS UPSET CHANCES AT STEELERS. JOIN ME.
952397439691968514,2018-01-14 04:30:18,"Not like Belichick to challenge a catch that was so clearly a catch. It's getting late, Bill."
952396490923638784,2018-01-14 04:26:32,"Tony Romo, who has had a sensational rookie broadcast season, is not having a great night. He made a passionate case that everyone has been wrong, this was going to be a very close battle. Now he's knocking down an ESPN story that was well reported and rang true in many ways."
952392874665979905,2018-01-14 04:12:10,"As a guy who picked the Patriots to win it all, I fear Jacksonville a little more than I do a Pittsburgh that would at least have the law of averages on its side vs NE. Jacksonville has a defense that can cause any QB problems, even The Greatest Ever."
952391878925680640,2018-01-14 04:08:13,"With LeGarrette in Philly and Burkhead hurt and free agent Gillislee an inactive disappointment, Belichick had to put this game mostly in Brady's hands. Result: 337 yards passing, 3 TDs and zero INTs in little more than 3 quarters."
952390659146592256,2018-01-14 04:03:22,"Ir's 35-7 ... but I will hear all next week on Undisputed that the Patriots ""stole"" this game thanks to bad calls. To quote a former Patriots receiver, ""Child, please."""
952389989022670849,2018-01-14 04:00:42,"Brady to Gronk, TD -- bye-bye Byard."
952389512902066177,2018-01-14 03:58:49,"And commentators on Undisputed often ridicule Tom Brady as ""unathletic."" Was that 3rd-down scramble and fallaway rainbow all the way back across the field and over the DB to Amendola ""unathletic""???"
952388070753513472,2018-01-14 03:53:05,"Funny: Kevin Byard has been reduced to smacking Gronk in the face mask then grabbing his jersey, drawing a flag as he attempts to turn Brady into Bortles."
952386199783485445,2018-01-14 03:45:39,"Finally, right on time, the Patriots are starting to flash some pass rush we haven't seen much of all season long. Great sign."
952384257967575040,2018-01-14 03:37:56,Brady doesn't get nearly enough credit for how he controls the game by checking to the perfect defense-beating play. That's why he should win MVP. He lifted a pretty average team to the AFC's No. 1 seed.
952382995918307333,2018-01-14 03:32:55,"If in fact Josh McDaniels leaves (again), Brady should be allowed to call his own plays next season. Many star QBs used to. Brady already changes many of his pre-snap."
952377939626115072,2018-01-14 03:12:49,"Yet another Vanderbilt football product making a big NFL contribution. Vandy, best school in America."
952375216243589120,2018-01-14 03:02:00,"So far Brady's arm has been NE's legs - 31 passes to only 13 runs. In years past this second half would belong to LeGarrette Blount. Now it's more about ""long handoffs"" tossed by the 40-years-young QB."
952373904030355457,2018-01-14 02:56:47,So in the first half NE got two breaks on 50-50 calls ... then it evened out when Gostkowski hook-missed a very makable 53-yard field goal. Patriots in charge 21-7.
952370244605034496,2018-01-14 02:42:15,"Somehow, Tom Brady is looking nothing like Blake Bortles. He's slicing and dicing like THE GREATEST QUARTERBACK EVER."
952366423896031233,2018-01-14 02:27:04,Big drop by Chris Hogan on second down.
952364559918022659,2018-01-14 02:19:39,"Remember, during the regular season, Mariota threw more interceptions than TD passes, 15 to 13, and had a QBR (which takes into account running as well as passing) worse than Blake Bortles. So ..."
952356551104200704,2018-01-14 01:47:50,The Patriots are letting Mariota gain more confidence by the throw and especially run.
952349252243488768,2018-01-14 01:18:50,"KEVIN BYARD, MEET ROB GRONKOWSKI ... AS YOU TRY TO BACK UP TURNING TOM BRADY INTO BLAKE BORTLES."

952340052113162240,2018-01-14 00:42:16,I'm surprised Julio didn't catch that and come down cleanly with it ... the kind of play Julio has routinely made.
952339447835586561,2018-01-14 00:39:52,That ball looked as loose as the last one.
952337509916147712,2018-01-14 00:32:10,"To survive, the Eagles are going to have to force a turnover."
952336571306422272,2018-01-14 00:28:26,Great throw by Matt Ryan. I would've punted.
952335805711724545,2018-01-14 00:25:24,Sanu did not control that ball to the ground. Incomplete.
952333452522614784,2018-01-14 00:16:03,"That was a ""win"" for Atlanta, holding Eagles to 3. #WhyEagleswhy"
952328738225627136,2018-01-13 23:57:19,"It's amazing the Eagles are leading this game going to the 4th quarter after all the dumb mistakes they've made, including 2 turnovers to Atlanta's none. #SighEaglesSigh"
952312351503433728,2018-01-13 22:52:12,"Eagles are going to have to start getting to Matt Ryan, knock him down, rough him up, force a turnover. Not getting nearly enough pressure."
952309001923936256,2018-01-13 22:38:53,"TERRIBLE CALL. THAT WAS A TERRIFIC FOOTBALL PLAY, NOT A 15-YARD PENALTY."
952308278318350337,2018-01-13 22:36:01,"YOU ARE KIDDING ME. Missing the extra point was bad enough. But that's a mistake in a cold tight playoff game you obviously CANNOT MAKE. Advantage, Atlanta."
952305397049651200,2018-01-13 22:24:34,Eagles should go for this with Blount force.
952296174614036480,2018-01-13 21:47:55,Bad sign: a tough talented Philly D didn't look as ready to play as I expected. I was having flashbacks to a year ago when the defense of the NFC's No. 1 seed wasn't ready to play at home vs Aaron Rodgers.
952293985027960832,2018-01-13 21:39:13,Eagles got an ugly break then the ex-Dolphin RB gave it right back. My question: Why did Peterson ask Foles to throw deep on the first play against a strong cold wind???
952292317116776448,2018-01-13 21:32:35,Join me on Facebook live after this game as I react to Eagles-Falcons and to the analysts making a case for Titans upsetting Brady at Brady.
952291863347609600,2018-01-13 21:30:47,"I'm going with the monumental upset: Eagles lifted by their fans in  the windy cold. Foles has started 40 NFL games, including playing well in a narrow playoff loss. He will play well enough, capitalizing on Ertz. #FlyEaglesFly"
952008289545469952,2018-01-13 02:43:58,"LeShannon Sharpe is so lucky we don't have Undisputed tomorrow. But we will be there Monday, MLK Day, as always 9:30-noon E. You can also join me live on Facebook after each of the 4 NFL playoff games tomorrow and Sunday. Can't wait."
952006338812420096,2018-01-13 02:36:13,"LeBron blew it. He forced the switch, from his nemesis Lance Stephenson to 6-foot Darren Collison, and drove baseline as he should have, BUT HE STEPPED OUT OF BOUNDS BEFORE MISSING THE LAYUP. No! Cavs needed the King to close this one and end the losing. No clutch gene."
952002624005455872,2018-01-13 02:21:27,LeBron should win this game now.

951657438406524928,2018-01-12 03:29:48,"Without Kyle Lowry and Ibaka, Toronto embarrassed LeBron and Co. by 34 ... and the Cavs just lost at Minnesota by 28. Maybe LeBron wants to show he can win the East as the 8 seed."
951648324305633281,2018-01-12 02:53:35,It's the Clevelan Cavaliers. No D. Worst defensive team in the NBA. Just gave up 100 at Toronto in three quarters.
951594208254504960,2018-01-11 23:18:33,"Uh, Kevin Byard: Blake Bortles had a better statistical season than your QB, Mariota. In fact, Bortles is better than your QB, and now you have to face Bortles (and his D and run game) twice a season. Have fun with that!"
951593606413893632,2018-01-11 23:16:10,"The Titans' Kevin Byard just made a big mistake ratting the cage of Psycho Tom, saying he wants to make Brady look like Bortles. Kevin, meet Rob Gronkowski and prepare to have Brady in your face yelling, ""WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE NOW?"""
951592196855160841,2018-01-11 23:10:34,"Talking with Brice Butler today on Undisputed, sounded like he won't re-sign with Cowboys unless 1) Dez or 2) TWill are gone. So I'm thinking Brice (who led the NFL with 21 yards per catch and has run 4.3) will sign elsewhere. Too bad. Love his rapport with Dak, on/off field."
951590862621884416,2018-01-11 23:05:16,"KD's 20,000 points more impressive than LeBron's. Took KD only 11 more games than LBJ. Plus, in 3 of his OKC seasons, Westbrook TOOK MORE SHOTS THAN KD. Pre-20,000, LBJ never had to deal with a Russ."

950598377355399169,2018-01-09 05:21:29,Congrats to Nick Saban and Alabama for finally winning a game the Tide should've won far more easily.
950596684383338496,2018-01-09 05:14:45,"Unbelievable. That was 2nd and TWENTY-SIX and Georgia just allowed a 41-yard touchdown pass to win the national championship. Again, that was the same Georgia defense that allowed 31 to Oklahoma in the first half."
950594212537380865,2018-01-09 05:04:56,Saban obviously made the right move to switch quarterbacks. Bama deserves to win this game.
950593747300962304,2018-01-09 05:03:05,I HATE FIELD-GOAL KICKING. SUCH AN ABSURD GIMMICK AND UNFAIR WAY TO DECIDE A GAME THAT HAD BEEN PLAYED SO WELL BY REAL FOOTBALL PLAYERS. I FEEL SORRY FOR EVERYONE ON THE BAMA TEAM AND FOR THAT POOR KID THRUST INTO THAT NATIONAL-CHAMPIONSHIP SPOT.
950589782052106240,2018-01-09 04:47:19,"On that play, Tagovailoa made Saban look like a gutsy genius. Gutsy patience and throw by the kid."

950574960526770177,2018-01-09 03:48:26,This has gone from Blake Bortles vs Tyrod Taylor to a bombs-away shootout.
950574737402417152,2018-01-09 03:47:32,I wouldn't have overturned that. TD should stand. Too close to call. Amazing read and throw by Fromm.
950572406589988864,2018-01-09 03:38:17,"After a shaky start, Tua started going Baker Mayfield on the Dawgs. They are torchable."
950569049708101632,2018-01-09 03:24:56,"Very surprised Saban panicked this early and went to Tagovailoa IN THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.  Tua had an viral spin TD throw when it was 45-0 vs my school, Vanderbilt, but this is THE game."
950562300766728193,2018-01-09 02:58:07,Oklahoma scored 31 in the first half on Georgia. Alabama scored zero.
950560440324521986,2018-01-09 02:50:44,Alabama is getting embarrassed.
950551462098042880,2018-01-09 02:15:03,"Saban is fortunate he doesn't have the Cleveland Cavaliers' defense right now or he'd be down 30 instead of 3. Minnesota 69, Cavs 42 at half."
950540878732345345,2018-01-09 01:33:00,"Jalen Hurts is a more dangerous runner than a thrower. Obviously missed an easy TD throw to Ridley, the most talented player on the field. False start, missed FG, Nick already on a sideline rampage."
950539578342912000,2018-01-09 01:27:50,"A week ago, Oklahoma hung 31 on the this Georgia defense IN THE FIRST HALF."
950538851478466560,2018-01-09 01:24:57,Poor throw from the freshman quarterback. Could've been a touchdown. Interception off terrific play by Tony Brown.
950537042626146304,2018-01-09 01:17:45,"Bama 20-10. A gimme for Saban: a meat-and-potatoes running team with a freshman QB. Exactly what this defense has for dinner. Congrats, Nick. No Baker Mayfield."

950168297361760256,2018-01-08 00:52:30,Saints didn't win as much as they just survived.
950165494388047872,2018-01-08 00:41:21,"Unbelievable: Saints can't convert a game-closing 3rd-and-2 with Kamara off tackle. Now Cam gets the ball back. Even if Saints hang on, I've lost some faith in their winning at Minnesota. Has hurt losing 2 offensive linemen."
950158811347562496,2018-01-08 00:14:48,Cam now has the momentum in a game that has become extremely winnable for him now that Greg Olsen is starting to look Pro Bowl healthy again.
950156844659458048,2018-01-08 00:06:59,Saints big push this season was to balance up run/pass. So far today they have 31 yards rushing to 273 passing. Now they need a long clock-killing drive producing points. Bet you Payton/Brees keep flinging.
950142766670991360,2018-01-07 23:11:03,"Panthers hang in with a third field goal. I still give them a shot with Cam hot and Kamara missing from Saints run game - 2 carries, 3 yards."
950140884686798848,2018-01-07 23:03:34,No way Sean Lee would've whiffed trying to tackle the fullback on a goal line play. Luke Kuechly did. He's obviously no Sean Lee.
950140460885880832,2018-01-07 23:01:53,Put Cam in at linebacker.
950134622502842368,2018-01-07 22:38:41,Put Cam in at safety.
950128098036531200,2018-01-07 22:12:45,If only Cam Newton still had Ted Ginn Jr.
950127504336896002,2018-01-07 22:10:24,"These Panthers are Cam or bust. He's their everything and today he is ON, with his accuracy and his running explosiveness. But he can't catch his own TD ropes or kick his own field goals. Great drive, zero points."
950116319415840768,2018-01-07 21:25:57,"Roethlisberger said he wanted Jacksonville, so he could prove he's better than the 5 interceptions he threw in the 30-9 home loss to the Jags on Oct. 8. Ben: Be careful what you wish for."
950115423546044416,2018-01-07 21:22:23,"Jacksonville just won a playoff game with Bortles throwing for 87 yards and Fournette running 21 times for 57 yards. The shock, of course, is that Bortles ran 10 times for 88. Can't make you miss but at 6-5, 240 can run straight ahead."
950106486037913600,2018-01-07 20:46:53,Tony Romo is making a 10-3 game with 6 minutes left so much more entertaining with his kid-on-Christmas enthusiasm. So glad he's in the booth and not on the field.
950091254900998144,2018-01-07 19:46:21,"Buffalo has a shot to pull off the upset at Sacksonville because Tyrod Taylor is considerably better than Blake Bortles - better passer, better runner. Bortles did have 2 big open-freeway scrambles late in 1st half. but he's no Tyrod."
950051613414080512,2018-01-07 17:08:50,"I agree with LaVar on this: I don't love the way Luke coaches the Lakers, who are way better than their record. But LaVar can't keep blaming coaches for his sons' failures or mistakes or they are never going to learn to make it on their own."
950050885123518464,2018-01-07 17:05:56,"What's LaVar going to do now, pull his No. 1 son off the Lakers because he doesn't like the way Luke is coaching Lonzo, then take Lonzo to Lithuania to play with his two younger brothers?"
949862981185122304,2018-01-07 04:39:16,I liked Atlanta in this game because the Rams haven't played dominantly at home all season. But I still like the Saints to win the NFC.
949862196489592832,2018-01-07 04:36:09,"Deion Jones just got away with bear-hugging Sammy Watkins before he cleanly broke up the pass. Refs have to call that hold, even on crucial 4th-and-goal late in the game. Atlanta probably would've won any way, but COME ON."
949834406893531137,2018-01-07 02:45:44,"At WVa, Jevon Carter just did an NBA-quality defensive number on Trae Young, forcing him into 8 turnovers, 3-12 from 3, only 5 assists. Still, the kid showed 2nd-half toughness, scoring 20 to get to his average, 29. Steph-like, but not Steph."
949807051441504257,2018-01-07 00:57:02,"I will miss you on ""Monday Night Football,"" coach Gruden. Good luck in Oakland. Second time will be the charm."
949806368977928192,2018-01-07 00:54:19,"I'm still not sold on Mariota as a QB, but he is a gamer, a battler. Doesn't have a great feel for the position. Missed a wide-open TD throw. But made the biggest to the butter-fingered Decker, made a clutch block and got lucky on the batted TD to himself."
949805374034534400,2018-01-07 00:50:22,"No way KC blows that lead if Kelce hadn't been knocked out of the game, obviously helmet to helmet."
949765836671139841,2018-01-06 22:13:15,"As he raves about the Chiefs on ESPN, soon-to-be-Raiders coach Jon Gruden has to be thinking, ""I have to deal with THIS twice a year?"""
949750772438261760,2018-01-06 21:13:24,"Nick Saban is so lucky he doesn't have to deal with Baker Mayfield, just the kind of quarterback that has shredded his vaunted defenses on the biggest stages."
949750278860947456,2018-01-06 21:11:26,"Predictable &amp; commendable Bob Kraft sought a damage-control interview. After all, his team is still favored to win a 6th Lombardi. But he cannot be happy with how Belichick gave away Garoppolo &amp; Brissett and with an ESPN story that clearly mostly came from the coach's confidants."

949384518271578112,2018-01-05 20:58:02,Brady is so old he's about to win MVP and he has the marginally talented Patriots positioned as the Super Bowl favorite. Brady says he can play at this level until he's 45. Do not bet against him.
949383932931289088,2018-01-05 20:55:42,"Kraft obviously made the right choice. Brady is far more valuable than Belichick. But the coach has earned the right to show he can win a SBowl without Brady. Yet if Belichick leaves, good luck to him without Brady."
949383101473423360,2018-01-05 20:52:24,"Seems to me when Kraft ordered Belichick to trade Garoppolo, Belichick decided he would soon leave and sabotaged the Pats' future by giving Jimmy G to Kyle Shanahan, a favorite of his, for only a 2nd rounder. Gave away Brissett, too. Hoodie has some scoundrel in him."

949075084265705473,2018-01-05 00:28:27,LeBron came into last night's game LEADING THE LEAGUE IN MINUTES PLAYED IN HIS 15TH SEASON!!! What's he DOING? Building career stats is the only way he'll make a case against MJ. But how will he be fresh for the playoffs? Now it's stats over titles?
949074097610240000,2018-01-05 00:24:32,"Please explain how LeBron played a tremendous 1st half last night, then looked out of it in 3rd quarter (1-6, two missed layups), then sat entire 4th quarter. Has he been playing way too many minutes this yr and got tired? Or did he give up on his sorry-shooting teammates?"
949072820276838400,2018-01-05 00:19:27,"Now LeBron finds himself in a tricky situation. If Isaiah Thomas starts shoot-shoot-shooting and scoring, &amp; the Cavs start winning again, LeBron will lose his MVP shine and momentum."
949071938575466496,2018-01-05 00:15:57,"Isaiah Thomas had his night last night. Forget the video tribute, Celtics. Move on. Force I.T. to move on &amp; become a Cav. This little man just might be a bigger diva than LeBron, who will struggle to juggle I.T.'s enormous ego."
949071084921307136,2018-01-05 00:12:34,"Paul Pierce is right: He shouldn't have to share his jersey retirement night with ANYBODY. He was a far more valuable Celtic than Isaiah Thomas.

948756493465104384,2018-01-04 03:22:29,Isaiah Thomas will make the Cavs a little better offensively. But he'll make their defense even worse - it now ranks second to last. And LeBron will struggle to sacrifice some of his stats to make IT happy.
948755988949041152,2018-01-04 03:20:29,Clearly a deep bond of love remains between the Celtics players and former Celtic Isaiah Thomas. Beautiful to see. But now Isaiah is going to have to let all that go and give in to being a Cleveland Cavalier.

948385819294748672,2018-01-03 02:49:34,I'm pretty interested in Georgia-Alabama. I would've been on fire for Baker Mayfield vs Nick Saban.
948385481753952256,2018-01-03 02:48:13,"I can't get it out of my head that Baker Mayfield had chances to win the game with 5 minutes left, with 55 seconds left and twice in overtime. If he were That Guy, a Deshaun, a Tebow ..."
948384575201320960,2018-01-03 02:44:37,"24 hours later, I still cannot believe Oklahoma lost that game. In all my rooting life, I've never been more devastated and dumbfounded. The Sooners were so great. And so bad. So many chances. Such agony."
948374113839534080,2018-01-03 02:03:03,The Cavs are now IT's team.
948358970665680896,2018-01-03 01:02:52,LeBron rarely gets the calls James Harden regularly does. Refs just don't have great respect for him. Maybe he complains too much. Or maybe refs think he's so big/strong/quick he doesn't need their help.
948353358833762305,2018-01-03 00:40:34,"Isaiah Thomas needs the ball and he needs to shoot it and he's never been that interested in playing defense. With Kyrie in place of IT, Celts have gone from 12th to 1st in defensive efficiency. Cavs are 2nd to last in D. Good luck with IT, LBJ."

948021346486898688,2018-01-02 02:41:17,I'll swear that blown squib and late first-half Georgia field goal from 56 yards was the turning point. Instead of 31-14 it was 31-17 and Ga brought that momentum back out for the second half.

948015772881653760,2018-01-02 02:19:08,Congratulations to the Georgia Bulldogs. They were the better tesm and deserved to win.
947996370614362114,2018-01-02 01:02:02,This is a disaster.
947993951763513346,2018-01-02 00:52:25,THAT IS ALL-TIME PATHETIC - AN LA FREEWAY TO THE END ZONE. SO EASY I'M NO LONGER SURE THIS DEFENSE CAN EVEN GIVE OU A CHANCE TO WIN.
947993062113816576,2018-01-02 00:48:53,"At some point, somebody is going to cough up a turnover."
947992750124818433,2018-01-02 00:47:39,Maybe that cheapshot will set off Baker Mayfield.
947991804619583489,2018-01-02 00:43:53,All of a sudden the OU offensive line is going Cowboys offensive line and getting its golden tails WHIPPED. Bad sign.
947990275166633984,2018-01-02 00:37:49,"COME ON, 6: BE BAKER MAYFIELD."
947989871129276418,2018-01-02 00:36:12,"As backed up as OU now is, I'm relieved Kirby Smart didn't go for that 4th and a foot. Pretty sure Ga would've made it, if not broken it for a TD."
947987885407342592,2018-01-02 00:28:19,I won't be surprised if it's soon 31-all. Stoops Factor.
947986749887619073,2018-01-02 00:23:48,THAT IS JUST SORRY. MISSED TACKLES. BAKER MAYFIELD IS GOING TO HAVE TO WIN THIS GAME. THE OU DEFENSE SURE CAN'T.
947986272689123329,2018-01-02 00:21:54,"I must admit, Georgia is starting to figure out how to contain the OU attack."
947985961895452672,2018-01-02 00:20:40,"Huge for Georgia. The second OU play was a broken-play bust. Poor start. Advantage, Georgia. Momentum shift. 'Dogs back in it."
947979161955590145,2018-01-01 23:53:39,"As many said, this Georgia defense is just too fast and physical for the Oklahoma offense."
947978580339724288,2018-01-01 23:51:20,Stupid squib mistake. So their kicker missed one he should've made and made one he shouldn't have.
947977070033776640,2018-01-01 23:45:20,BOOMER SOONER: What a call by Lincoln Riley.

947970526932123648,2018-01-01 23:19:20,"OK, so Baker didn't go 4 for his first 4 scoring touchdowns. Just a field goal. This Georgia defense is talented and extremely well coached."
947967915185156096,2018-01-01 23:08:58,Please let Rpdney Anderson be OK. He just got avalanched.
947966845692211200,2018-01-01 23:04:43,That's the quickest way to squander a 21-7 lead. Just pathetic. This defense isn't great but it's better than THAT.
947965328742531072,2018-01-01 22:58:41,Told you: Rodney Gurley. SONIC BOOMER SOONER.
947963317980499968,2018-01-01 22:50:41,"Big miss. Baker, your turn."
947962049660727296,2018-01-01 22:45:39,It's starting to feel like nobody can stop anybody in this game.
947960688944676865,2018-01-01 22:40:15,"I said this morning on Undisputed (9:30-noon E, FS1) don't sleep on Rodney Anderson. I know Georgia has two very good backs, but RA is explosive running and catching. Has some Gurley in him."
947959400374747137,2018-01-01 22:35:07,Please don't let the Stoops Factor get me again. I liked Bob very much personally but wasn't the biggest fan of his. His brother Mike still coaches the OU defense. Gulp.
947958435756195841,2018-01-01 22:31:17,That made me a little queasy.
947956284745162752,2018-01-01 22:22:45,That was just sick.
947955269853626368,2018-01-01 22:18:43,"Shannon Sharpe, my partner on Undisputed, questioned how sick BakerMayfield has really been. Shannon said he wanted to build in an excuse, just in case the Ga D is too much for him. Now we see."
947954156970455040,2018-01-01 22:14:17,Must admit I'm surprised OU won the toss and didn't let Baker Mayfield take his first shot. Guess Lincoln Riley wanted to challenge his often maligned defense right away.
947953762093514752,2018-01-01 22:12:43,"I was born and raised an OU fan in Oklahoma City, so I can't help myself. Expect no objectivity from me. I respect Kirby Smart. But PLANT THAT FLAG, BAKER MAYFIELD. SONIC BOOMER SOONER. SHOW THOSE BULLDOGS WHO'S GOT SOME BULLDOG IN HIM, BAKER."

947570038294290432,2017-12-31 20:47:56,Dan Bailey has lost it.
947563054010572800,2017-12-31 20:20:11,As I said all last week: The kicker demons have now seized control of Dany Bailey's psyche. He just missed an extra point by a good 10 yards left. Big trouble going forward.
947562593597644800,2017-12-31 20:18:21,"Dak, rifle-shot on a skinny post for a TD ... to BRICE BUTLER. He's 6-3 215 and he's quicker and faster than Dez. I'll say it again: HE'S THE ONLY COWBOYS RECEIVER WHO CAN RUN BY A DEFENSIVE BACK."
947560325745844224,2017-12-31 20:09:21,"Brice Butler is finally heathy, he finally got on the field in the 3rd quarter, Dak finally threw one in his direction -- 30-YARD COMPLETION. What have I been saying and saying? He's averaging 22 yards a catch!"
947555849194520576,2017-12-31 19:51:33,"It is painful watching Dak Prescott trying to force completions to Dez Bryant, who has one 5-yard catch in 6 targets. This team would be better next year without No. 88."
947555262251941893,2017-12-31 19:49:13,"Sorry to inform Steelers Nation that James Harris, No. 92 for the New England Patriots, just made a tackle that just might have echoed all the way back to Pittsburgh."
947551960911065089,2017-12-31 19:36:06,"In the coldest regular-season game at NE since 1977, wind chill below zero, Tom Brady still has the Patriots up 21-3 at half. MVP. MVP. MVP."
947550696043266048,2017-12-31 19:31:05,"Cowboys-Eagles just hard to watch. Nothing at stake accept the figurative one the Seahawks drove through the Cowboys' hearts. Neither team wants to play in the brutal cold. Dak, Dez, Zeke iced over."

945082536140554240,2017-12-25 00:03:30,This was one long lost season. Dez drops. Sean Lee hamstring. Ty Smith injuries. Zeke suspension. Dak stuggles. Brice Butler gone. One thing after another after another after another.
945081396913102848,2017-12-24 23:58:58,I now give the Cowboys 0% chance to win this game.

945073341513084928,2017-12-24 23:26:57,"As I've been saying all season long: With Sean Lee, the Cowboys have a pretty good defense. Without him, they're pretty awful. No player on any other team is more valuable to his defense than Sean Lee is to his."
945071569205805056,2017-12-24 23:19:55,"COME ON, DAK, YOU'RE NOT GETTING PROTECTED. BLITZ IS COMING. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A QUICK DECISION AND GET RID OF THE FOOTBALL. TOO MUCH DEER IN HEADLIGHTS."
945070845688299520,2017-12-24 23:17:02,That pass I should've been on Cole Beasley.
945070687907037184,2017-12-24 23:16:25,It was worth it for Seattle to take the jump-in-the-kettle penalty. Fired up the sideline. Sent a message to Zeke.
945069825839132672,2017-12-24 23:12:59,Here we go again: DISASTER. Dak was just trying to throw it away. Didn't anticipate Coleman could break on the ball out of the zone. Pick six. Just horrendous. Now I don't love the Cowboys' chances. Seattle has been given life and momentum.
945068806199681024,2017-12-24 23:08:56,"Dez will go one of two ways this half: He'll get mad, lock back in and make a couple of plays. Or he will pout and throw sideline fits and sap the energy out of his team."
945066484568436736,2017-12-24 22:59:43,The obvious plan of attack is to let Zeke pound away and hopefully wear out the proud Seattle D.
945065464165687296,2017-12-24 22:55:39,I can't remember watching a team that wears me out more than this Cowboys team. This season has been one ... lonnnnngggg ... struggggggglllle.
945063724225675265,2017-12-24 22:48:44,That wasn't pretty but I'll take it. Dak's finally did it himself.
945060343314649088,2017-12-24 22:35:18,"People don't understand how much it is hurting this team that Brice Butler has been out with a foot injury. The Cowboys would be so much better with him than Dez Bryant. Now, they're stuck with Dez."
945059345221304320,2017-12-24 22:31:20,This is headed toward 7-6 Seattle at half.
945059015125536768,2017-12-24 22:30:02,You are KIDDING ME! Please get Dez Bryant out of there. He's a liability.
945058452769980416,2017-12-24 22:27:48,Good teams don't keep making dumb penalties at the end of punt returns after big defensive stands. Just drains the momentum.
945058000401608705,2017-12-24 22:26:00,What a terrfiic athletic play on the NFL's most elusive QB by DeMarcus Lawrence.
945057039822209024,2017-12-24 22:22:11,It's getting real close to Dez Bryant being more trouble than he's worth.
945056803577982976,2017-12-24 22:21:14,Whew: Barely. I'll take 6-0. But Seattle D is playing fast and mad after getting embarrassed at home by their division rivals last Sunday.
945054874189758464,2017-12-24 22:13:34,"Eat, Zeke, eat."
945053969994235904,2017-12-24 22:09:59,Mayowa starting to go Adrian Clayborn.
945051813362917376,2017-12-24 22:01:25,Eric Dickerson went public on Undisputed about the bet Zeke made with him when he visited Zeke in Cabo: Zeke said he'd get 200+ vs Seattle (before Seattle lost 42-7). Game-worn jersey vs game-worn. Maybe Eric went public to inspire the Seahawks and improve his chances.
945043727206170624,2017-12-24 21:29:17,"Without Brice Butler, Dak Prescott has no receiver who can get behind anyone. Dez killed the opening series with a killer drop."
945043350016552960,2017-12-24 21:27:47,"Dez Bryant, YET ANOTHER DROP."
945036541948133376,2017-12-24 21:00:44,"REMEMBER: SHANNON AND I ARE LIVE TOMORROW, CHRISTMAS DAY, ON UNDISPUTED, 9:30-NOON E, FS1."

945035485096820736,2017-12-24 20:56:32,"Brady throws a pass over the middle to newcomer and Browns castoff Kenny Britt that gets intercepted and returned for a TD, then scores the next five times he has the ball, puts on an MVP performance in the second half. Patriots are pretty mediocre ... except for the quarterback."
945033965735309312,2017-12-24 20:50:29,"Just now Tony Romo couldn't remember the last name of Tim GROVER, who trained the greatest ever, Michael Jordan. MJ believed in Tim just the way Brady believes in his trainer."
945020425871880192,2017-12-24 19:56:41,Patriots locked in what feels like will be down-to-the-wire battle with Bills angry over TD pass robbery at end of half and inspired by viewing Wofford upset of UNC on Saturday night. My money's still on Brady.
944999318032760832,2017-12-24 18:32:49,"Today the Patriots offense is featuring an undrafted rookie tight end from Wyoming named Jacob Hollister, even running him on a jet sweep. Unreal. JACOB HOLLISTER. Another reason Tom Brady is MVP to this point."
944429893470666752,2017-12-23 04:50:07,"As I keep saying, Lonzo Ball shot 41% from 3 at UCLA and often made clutch bombs. 4 for 4 in 1st tonight at GSt. As the target painted on his back by his dad shrinks, he'll shoot better and better."
944017569899356160,2017-12-22 01:31:42,"Joy, Shannon and I have the day off tomorrow. But we return to Undisputed on Monday, Christmas morning, 9:30-noon E, to debate Sunday's NFL action and the Christmas Day NBA clashes. JOIN US CHRISTMAS MORNING."

943690229919240193,2017-12-21 03:50:58,"Lonzo again led the Lakers in rebounding, with 9, and came alive to make several clutch shots, free throws and plays down the stretch that had to be made to hold off the Rockets."
943689770298892288,2017-12-21 03:49:08,"Kyle Kuzma was asked after scoring 38 at Houston if he thought he could be this good this fast in the NBA. ""Yes,"" he said without hesitation. Love it. Believe it."
943688913952030721,2017-12-21 03:45:44,"What a win for the Lakers, beating NBA's best team at Houston. Nothing lucky or fluky about it. Yes, CP3 lost, again, but I loved this Lakers team before the season and it will get better and BETTER."
943665955762192384,2017-12-21 02:14:30,Lonzo again shows flashes of his basketball genius but again too often drifts and watches. If only he had some of Kuzma's all-out attack mode.
943665385940819968,2017-12-21 02:12:15,"Kyle Kuzma, steal of the draft, goes Rockets on the Rockets in the 1st half, making all six 3s and all 9 shots. Yet for all that, the Lakers manage only a 4-point lead."
943586142045089792,2017-12-20 20:57:21,"If the Cowboys somehow slip through the backdoor into the playoffs, they will get to the Super Bowl."
943585781066612736,2017-12-20 20:55:55,"In their primes MJ, Kobe and Bird would have slammed the door shut on that game. LeBron was a -2 in the final 3:38 he played. I'm still not sure how he muffed that errant pass that went through his legs to Greek Freak, who closed the deal with an and-one."
943584825620905984,2017-12-20 20:52:08,"How did LeBron not close that game last night with a W? Shellshocked Bucks had lost 3 straight, just suffered a 24-3 run. But LeBron wasted 3 trips (2 missed 3s, kicked ball out to Korver for missed 3) instead of ATTACKING THE BASKET AND AT LEAST GETTING TO THE LINE."
943583732950212608,2017-12-20 20:47:47,"If Carson Wentz had been the quarterback of this Patriots team all season, they'd be lucky to be 5-11, which Belichick was the season before Bledsoe got hurt and he hit the lottery with a 6th-rounder named Brady."
943582873772163072,2017-12-20 20:44:22,Sometimes I wish Lonzo had a little more LaVar in him.
943582721175044096,2017-12-20 20:43:46,"What I like about LaVar Ball is he thinks big and he thinks fearlessly. He just might make his news league work, as an extension of AAU."

943325922786123776,2017-12-20 03:43:20,Let it sink in what Tom Brady just pulled off AGAIN at Pittsburgh. At 40 years old! The Steelers lead the NFL with 8 Pro Bowl players. The Pats basically have just 2: Brady and Gronk (Develin made it as a fullback and Slater as a special-teamer). 2 was all they needed.
943324260805644289,2017-12-20 03:36:44,The Bucks should've won that game by 20. They're now all of 16-13. The East is such a cakewalk for the King.
943323432971726850,2017-12-20 03:33:27,"Only way Cavs got back in that game was because LeBron was on the bench and the Bucks started coasting. Gave up a 24-2 run in the 4th quarter AND THE NON-LEBRONS ACTUALLY TOOK THE LEAD. LeBron returned, made a deep 3, predictably missed the next 2, Bucks prevail."
943322530751774720,2017-12-20 03:29:52,"LeBron had the game in his hands off an awful Bucks pass, couldn't hang on, couldn't find the ball on the floor beneath him ... Greek Freak did. And one. That was basically the game."
943285868617392128,2017-12-20 01:04:11,LeBron is obviously playing great basketball. But MVP? Please show me one truly impressive Cavs' win. I'll give you at Detroit. Pistons are 17-13. Otherwise ...
943244006929997824,2017-12-19 22:17:50,"After watching Lonzo turn it on in overtime last night, made me wonder if he sometimes toys with games. For much of the first 4 quarters, he just played hot potato, passing nonchalantly to wing players without trying to create. Drives me NUTS. Attack, young man!"
943243270317998080,2017-12-19 22:14:54,"My all-time top 10 in order: MJ, Magic, Shaq, Kareem, TimDuncan, BillRussell, Kobe, LarryBird, LeBron, Wilt. LeBron just doesn't have the assassin in him that MJ, Kobe and Bird did, and Bird was a far better shooter, especially in the clutch."

942617517427589122,2017-12-18 04:48:23,I'm going live on Facebook right now to talk about this minor miracle.
942617366898253824,2017-12-18 04:47:47,I just had to pick myself up off the floor. Jeff Heath finally made a play. The Cowboys live.
942615777206722560,2017-12-18 04:41:28,"Just a disaster. Anthony Brown had the season in his hands, dropped the interception. Now, season just about over ..."
942614018652434433,2017-12-18 04:34:29,"That was so incredibly bad. Obviously you HAVE TO SCORE SEVEN POINTS THERE. Now, big trouble."
942612237264359424,2017-12-18 04:27:24,"FINALLY. AGAIN. WELCOME BACK, DEZ."
942611790692618241,2017-12-18 04:25:38,Lord have mercy. That did not look like Dak made the first down. No idea how that got ruled in favor of Dallas.
942608125118464001,2017-12-18 04:11:04,"Derek Carr has not been sacked once and the Raiders are 8 of 12 on 3rd down. Just when I thought you could start trusting this team, it reverts."
942607030530990080,2017-12-18 04:06:43,An end around to an end who can't run???
942604186276970496,2017-12-18 03:55:25,This is starting to feel not meant to be.
942603687246958593,2017-12-18 03:53:26,Ball hit the ground without control.
942600567947329536,2017-12-18 03:41:02,That's the best way for Dak to get it in the end zone. Run it himself.
942600022725574656,2017-12-18 03:38:52,FINALLY.
942599936981401600,2017-12-18 03:38:32,Dez Bryant is a basket case. That pass went right through his hands.
942599075840475136,2017-12-18 03:35:06,"TERRANCE WILLIAMS, YOU HAVE TO CATCH THAT."
942598835154513920,2017-12-18 03:34:09,What a gamble. What a play by Chris Jones.
942598475820122112,2017-12-18 03:32:43,Now the Cowboys can't run or pass protect. Offensive line is getting whipped.
942596795254808576,2017-12-18 03:26:03,"If the Cowboys keep putting Dak in 3rd and 9 deep in their territory, bad things will happen. Nobody can get open. Line is not pass protecting."
942595797757018112,2017-12-18 03:22:05,This is a disaster.
942595257413222400,2017-12-18 03:19:56,What is Ryan Switzer DOING?
942594799827263488,2017-12-18 03:18:07,Now I'm hoping the pass Dez didn't try for and the fumble Heath failed to recover don't come back to haunt the Cowboys.
942594509271003136,2017-12-18 03:16:58,That was ... just ... terrible. 90 yards! Now the crowd is back into it. Now the Raiders are back into it. Now it's a battle.
942589002682548224,2017-12-18 02:55:05,"OK, Cowboys got a break. NOW COME OUT, SHUT EM DOWN, GO SCORE, PUT THIS GAME AWAY, GO HOME TO ZEKE."
942587174360309760,2017-12-18 02:47:49,Hate to see the Cowboys give the Raiders points and life just before half. This game could've been over by now.
942584353112039424,2017-12-18 02:36:36,"Without Brice Butler, the Cowboys have no receiver who can separate from a defender beyond 10 yards. Makes it so difficult for a Dak who gets overeager to make a big play."
942581537228410880,2017-12-18 02:25:25,"As I keep saying on Undisputed, and Shannon Sharpe keeps ridiculing, the Cowboys are a pretty good defense with Sean Lee and a bad defense without him. Cris Collinsworth just strongly made that point on NBC. SeanLee is the Brady of D, calling out plays before they're run."
942577262754328576,2017-12-18 02:08:26,"In the pictures shared with NBC by Zeke's agent, he definitely looks in better shape than he did early this season. No more pot belly, much more definition. Good for Zeke. Cabo San Europe."
942569829067661313,2017-12-18 01:38:54,Dez pulled up on that throw from Dak. Looked like he wanted no part of the collision. Could've at least gotten his hands on it. That's right where he used to like it.
942568896745299968,2017-12-18 01:35:11,"No way that was offensive interference! Against TWill, who isn't exactly a physical receiver???"
942568404862492673,2017-12-18 01:33:14,"Oh, no: Again no Brice Butler, no David Irving. This won't be easy."
942565002216579074,2017-12-18 01:19:43,Tom Brady just took the lead in the MVP race.
942564911678308352,2017-12-18 01:19:21,"By the letter of the NFL law - and this law is just wrong - that was NOT a catch by Jesse James. But given the spirit of football, the eye test, that was an obvious catch and touchdown and the Steelers got robbed."
942564052219281408,2017-12-18 01:15:56,"Just finished Facebook live. I didn't even realize Ben had tried to fake-spike on the interception. So quick it fooled nobody. Steelers SHOULD'VE spiked it and gotten organized. The play was so helter-skelter all the Steelers looked confused, including Ben."
942550406239891456,2017-12-18 00:21:43,"I'm about to go live on Facebook to discuss what we just witnessed, as well as the Cowboy-Raiders matchup. JOIN ME NOW."
942549969654837248,2017-12-18 00:19:59,WOO-HOOOOOO. TOM BRADY DOES IT TO PITTSBURGH AGAIN.
942549239397171200,2017-12-18 00:17:05,"Once again, it's the Dez catch at Lambeau all over."
942548783597883392,2017-12-18 00:15:16,What a disastrous breakdown by the Patriots' defense.
942547842064777216,2017-12-18 00:11:31,TOM BRADY IS STILL THE NFL'S BEST QUARTERBACK AT AGE 40.
942547646996144128,2017-12-18 00:10:45,Did the Patriots score too quickly? Ben has been so magical late in so many games this season. But this time: No magical connection with AB.
942546619743985665,2017-12-18 00:06:40,I will go live on Facebook right after this game to talk Pat-Steelers and Cowboys-Raiders. I will also go live after Cowboys-Raiders. JOIN ME BOTH TIMES.
942544313837219840,2017-12-17 23:57:30,"The Patriots haven't been able to protect Brady for much of the season, and he's having to throw too many fallaways or eat it too often in this game."
942543636805296128,2017-12-17 23:54:49,Amendola wimped.
942543426582482944,2017-12-17 23:53:59,Obvious interference on Burns.
942543215869038593,2017-12-17 23:53:08,What a throw and catch -- all for naught. Cooks stepped out of bounds before the catch.
942538452859363331,2017-12-17 23:34:13,LBell is doing exactly what he should be against this terrible NE run defense. He has 105 yards through 3 quarters. The Patriots are obviously in BIG TROUBLE. Can't protect Brady. Can't stop Le'Veon.
942534929618894855,2017-12-17 23:20:13,Tom Brady finally made a mistake against the Steelers for the first time in 12 years. It was a big one. Tried to make a play while getting knocked backward.
942531951860244480,2017-12-17 23:08:23,"Now, your turn, coach Belichick."
942531784440295424,2017-12-17 23:07:43,"Gronk dropped a TD pass, then Brady made an amazing play, breaking upfield through the rush, stopping and whipping to Cooks for the TD. Another great drive from The Greatest Ever. If only he could kick extra points."
942530190852239360,2017-12-17 23:01:23,"Terrible false start by the new Patriot, Duane Allen, who has been major disappointment. But Brady able to get Gronk in single coverage on 4th down."
942529131513749504,2017-12-17 22:57:10,Sorry to hear Antonio Brown is out. Obviously big loss. But Ben still has NFL's leading rusher vs NE defense allowing an NFL-worst 5 yards per carry.
942527700685660160,2017-12-17 22:51:29,"The Steelers are beating Brady the best way, keeping him off the field. Steelers have run 35 plays to Brady's 20. Ben has had the ball TWICE as long, 20 minutes to 10. Now let's see what genius adjustments Belichick can make at half."
942525757145755648,2017-12-17 22:43:46,In the first half the Rams embarrassed and humiliated the once-proud Seahawks 34-0. Right now the Rams have as good a chance of getting to the Super Bowl as any team in the wide-open NFC.
942525254957645824,2017-12-17 22:41:46,"So far, the Steelers clearly look like the better team."
942524750827417601,2017-12-17 22:39:46,"Brady does not have a Martavis or a JuJu, and the Patriots are finding it extremely difficult to contain both. Martavis just made a second terrific game-changing catch. Just too good."
942523464883175424,2017-12-17 22:34:39,"No surprise: the Patriot defense can't stop Big Ben's flying circus, featuring the NFL's leading rusher."
942516709641957376,2017-12-17 22:07:49,"Hope Antonio Brown isn't too hurt, and is able to return soon, but he has to catch that touchdown pass."
942512086864732160,2017-12-17 21:49:27,"On paper, this Steelers-Patriots game should be a mismatch for the home team. Except for NE's QB."
942511885160628224,2017-12-17 21:48:39,"Remember, the Patriots are still missing their best front-7 player on defense, Kyle Van Noy, And obviously their most important defensive player, Donta Hightower, is gone. On offense, Brady is also down Chris Hogan today opposite all those weapons Ben has."
942509705800249344,2017-12-17 21:39:59,"The Steelers show Ryan Shazier up in a stadium box - great to see, crowd goes crazy ... and Tom Brady throws the Patriots right down the field to the 7-0 touchdown."
942506295537549312,2017-12-17 21:26:26,"Eagles allow almost 500 yards at Giants, barely survive. Hmmm. Maybe that Cowboy win at Giants was more impressive than most people thought."
942504895839584257,2017-12-17 21:20:52,Watch how Aaron Rodgers is given a pass as always by everyone on Undisputed tomorrow but me.
942504698413694976,2017-12-17 21:20:05,Aaron Rodgers had every opportunity to win that game BEFORE Geronimo fumbled it away.
942504421216329728,2017-12-17 21:18:59,That validates what happened in the Cowboys playoff game at Green Bay. The NFL robbed Dallas - maybe because the NFL just doesn't want Jerry to get too big for his britches.
942503644951298048,2017-12-17 21:15:54,If that's a catch and fumble then Dez's catch at Green Bay in the playoff game WAS A CATCH AND A TOUCHDOWN.
942487886397546496,2017-12-17 20:13:17,"That's twice this half that Packer receivers got behind defensive backs for touchdowns - and the great Aaron Rodgers underthrew both into interceptions. Layoff or no layoff, ""The Greatest Thrower of the Football Ever"" has to make those throws."
942487149231816704,2017-12-17 20:10:21,That last replay angle they showed on Fox confirmed that it was indeed a TD catch. No doubt. No controversy.
942483290581110784,2017-12-17 19:55:01,What was Thomas Davis thinking??? He doesn't know either. Appears to be taking it hard that he launched himself into a blindside shot to the head of Davante Adams after INT.
942479156595499008,2017-12-17 19:38:36,"Aaron Rodgers played pretty well in the first half of his return. He SHOULD win this game, as I said on Undisputed. He's on his way."
942247213949841408,2017-12-17 04:16:56,"Before the season I picked the Chargers to win the AFC West. They just imploded at KC. 3 quick turnovers (2 awful INTs by PhRivers). It all started when they blew an easy scoop&amp;score off a botched punt. Could've been 7-0. Congrats, Chiefs."
942242473119694848,2017-12-17 03:58:06,"The Spurs were down 3 starters (Kawhi, TParker, DGreen), yet ended the game on s 13-0 run over last 4 minutes while forcing 6 turnovers, the last by Manu to set up his game-winner. If this team gets and stays healthy, it will win the West."
942239769248989190,2017-12-17 03:47:21,"MANUUUUUUU GINOBILIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!! Bradyesque at age 40. Drives for the clutch game-winner with 3 seconds left. You watching, LeBron?"
941874661943422977,2017-12-16 03:36:33,"Rockets can strut their stuff, win by a million tonight as Spurs try to get Kawhi back into the flow. But you know what will happen in the playoffs. Ask James Harden what happened in Game 6 last season."
941872736556564480,2017-12-16 03:28:54,"What a weird, potentially great player is BenSimmons. Can't shoot a lick. But he's close to 7 feet, he's a gifted passer and he did an amazing job on Westbrook, often taking him straight up. Russ, 10 for 33, struggled with Simmons' length, quickness and savvy."
941871104657731585,2017-12-16 03:22:25,What a crazy game in Philly. Bottom line: Embiid and BenSimmons often made OKC's 3 established stars look like aging stars. Finally took plays by Roberson and Patterson to save the Big 3.
941786358628073472,2017-12-15 21:45:40,The Dallas Cowboys are going to win out.
941786142281572353,2017-12-15 21:44:48,So what LeBron really told Zo was pretty ho-hum. LeBron overdramatized the postgame jersey-covering-mouth scene to make himself the story. He kind of pulled a LaVar.
941785567510986752,2017-12-15 21:42:31,"One game or one shot for my life, I want Larry Bird in his prime shooting the ball. Not LeBron."
941785308990881792,2017-12-15 21:41:29,"Steelers have the NFL's leading rusher vs D allowing NFL-worst 5 yds a carry, have the NFL's best deep receiver vs torchable 2ndary, have won 8 straight while Pats just lost to Jay Cutler. But Pats will win because they have 12."

941673861849821185,2017-12-15 14:18:38,What did LeBron say to Lonzo? @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1
941513091979796480,2017-12-15 03:39:48,Who knew that on Lonzo Ball's first trip to Cleveland he would outshoot LeBron James from three?
941512196139261953,2017-12-15 03:36:14,"Lonzo again played pretty well - 13, 11 and 8 - but again left you wanting a little more down the stretch. Still, this was TNT in LeBron's house. Another positive baby step. Kid is special."
941511284092108801,2017-12-15 03:32:37,"LeBron won't say what he told Lonzo after the game as he covered his mouth with his jersey. I respect that. I assume it was positive advice. Maybe even told Zo he needs to become his own man, out of his father's shadow."
941504473754583042,2017-12-15 03:05:33,It will be too bad if Lonzo can't return on his turned ankle and play the 4th quarter as LeStat always does. Lonzo just might have had a triple double in the King's house.
941502916581408768,2017-12-15 02:59:22,Lonzo Ball shot 41% from 3 last year at UCLA and often made clutch game-turning 3s. He will become an effective 3-point shooter in the NBA.
941489553742880768,2017-12-15 02:06:16,I agree with Reggie. Brook Lopez RAN FROM even contesting LeBron's running-start dunk. He's 7 feet tall! He knew he was so wrong he immediately air-balled two free throws!
941483812407558144,2017-12-15 01:43:27,"Second-level stats say Lonzo Ball is 3rd fastest in the NBA with the ball in his hands. But when he snatches a rebound and quickly hits full long-strider speed, he's close to the fastest."
941483357937922048,2017-12-15 01:41:39,"Lonzo Ball has the same gift LeBron talks about having. Like LeBron, Lonzo is a once-a-generation passer of the basketball. Zo's gift was on full display in tonight's 1st quarter in LeBron's house."

941310994181062656,2017-12-14 14:16:44,LaVar is at it again with another bombshell interview. We debate. @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1.
941056814841499648,2017-12-13 21:26:43,"On Lonzo's first big night at Madison Square Garden, LaVar managed to upstage him during and after the game. Yet who and where would LaVar be without his oldest son?"
941055821982531585,2017-12-13 21:22:46,"In his first 27 NBA games at barely 20 years old, Lonzo has had a 29-pt game, a 16-rebound game, 2 13-assist games, a two 5-steal games and a 4-block game. But many consider him a failure because his father said he's better than Steph and made so many root against him."
941054744361078784,2017-12-13 21:18:29,"LeBron obviously can't catch Michael Jordan in Finals record - it's 6-0 vs 3-5. But if he stays in great shape and keeps piling up numbers in years 15, 16 and 17, he just might be able to convince a LeBron-loving media he's greater than MJ. #StriveforGreatness"
941053446781779968,2017-12-13 21:13:20,Will you Blind Witnesses please explain why your man LeBron played a game-high 35 minutes last nite &amp; game-high 9:30 in the 4th quarter of a home blowout vs THE WORST TEAM IN THE NBA. He leads the NBA in minutes played. Is he piling up stats to make his all-time greatest case?

940773561714720768,2017-12-13 02:41:10,"Late in this game, Michael Beasley played like what he once was - the 2nd overall pick. That overshadowed a nice game by current 2nd overall pick Lonzo Ball, who just does so many sensationally subtle things on offense, on defense, on the boards."
940768604081082369,2017-12-13 02:21:28,"Incredible: LaVar Ball is now so big he's trash-talking and clowning with SPIKE LEE courtside at Madison Square Garden. The man has talked his way onto the international map. Of course, his eldest son has helped."
940758835723165702,2017-12-13 01:42:39,"Welcome back, Kawhi Leonard. Now trust your doctors. You're going to be OK. Let it fly."
940756779352326149,2017-12-13 01:34:29,"Still amazes me that Lonzo Ball, ""soft"" point guard, leads the Lakers in rebounding for the season."

940750976562188290,2017-12-13 01:11:25,"With mom, dad and 2 brothers sitting courtside, Lonzo had a decent first half as Lakers trail by one at MSG. But Jordan Clarkson again has a hot hand so I figure Luke won't play Lonzo as much 2nd half. Then again, Magic also sitting courtside ..."
940702033295720448,2017-12-12 21:56:56,"Jay Cutler is 12-7 on Monday Night. 32 TD passes, 13 INTs. On the Monday Night stage he has beaten Brady, Rodgers, Favre, Vick and PhilipRivers. On Sunday night he has beaten Big Ben twice. Not bad for a loser."
940701326568177664,2017-12-12 21:54:08,"Jay Cutler doesn't have great leadership intangibles, but he has a great arm and high football IQ, he's athletic and he's tough and he's better than about half the NFL's starting quarterbacks.

939960014059446272,2017-12-10 20:48:25,What a sweet read and throw by DAK PRESCOTT.
939958962882936833,2017-12-10 20:44:15,That was not pass interference on JLewis. Just a bad throw.

939954222719680512,2017-12-10 20:25:24,Must ... get ... some ... heat ... on ... Eli. NOW.
939951730271207424,2017-12-10 20:15:30,This is just sad. Vanilla predictable game plan. Not much run game. Third and long. Nobody can get open. Dak runs for his life.
939950378681901057,2017-12-10 20:10:08,A good football team does not leave JPP completely unblocked so he can get a running start and blast Dak Prescott.
939949151453716480,2017-12-10 20:05:15,It has just been one of those years.
939946247560904704,2017-12-10 19:53:43,Incredible but predictable: Sean Lee' hamstring acting up again. Not in the game. BIG TROUBLE. I'll be surprised if the Cowboys can win without him.
939944777952280576,2017-12-10 19:47:53,I am so tired of 2nd down runs going nowhere.
939942904805474304,2017-12-10 19:40:26,Key to the second half: If the Cowboys can FINALLY  get some pressure on Eli.
939939150072967168,2017-12-10 19:25:31,Now we see what the 2017 Cowboys are made of.
939938925178523648,2017-12-10 19:24:37,I couldn't figure why Brice Butler hasn't been in. Just looked and saw he's inactive. That foot has been bothering him for weeks - surprised it kept him out after mini-bye. That puts even more pressure on Dez to GET MAD AND GET GOING.
939938036057436160,2017-12-10 19:21:05,"Incredibly, the Giants have so little respect for Dez that they left him in single coverage with Brandon Dixon, playing on his 7th team in 3 years. Dixon gambled and lost. Touchdown. Maybe that'll give Dez a little confidence."
939933603177291777,2017-12-10 19:03:28,"I'll say it again: The Cowboys have no receiver other than Brice Butler who can separate from a defender. Cole Beasley can but he's doubled nearly ever play. I'm just not sure what Dak is supposed to do, other than run for his life."
939932998798942208,2017-12-10 19:01:04,"As I said on Undisputed, for the Giants this is the CLASSIC CASE of new coach, return of a new old beloved QB, Eli, and what's still a pretty good defense, vs a hated rival. GREAT SPOT FOR AN UPSET."
939930446053261312,2017-12-10 18:50:56,"Dez Bryant has lost all confidence. Can't even catch a pass that hits him in the facemask. He has often been the biggest reason this season has been such a struggle. Dak keeps going to him, even though he can't separate any more. And Dez keeps coming up small."
939929872222232576,2017-12-10 18:48:39,UNBELIEVABLE: DEZ BRYANT IS A NIGHTMARE. GET BRICE BUTLER IN THERE. DEZ'S DROPS CONTAGIOUS. BEASLEY DROPS THE NEXT ONE. FOLLOWED BY A MISSED LONG FIELD GOAL. JUST SICKENING.
939922770212749313,2017-12-10 18:20:25,"Welcome back, Sean Lee. Now, hope that hamstring holds."
939921931020595200,2017-12-10 18:17:05,"Long but unimpressive first Cowboys drive. Started with YET ANOTHER Dez drop, one lucky play, hits &amp; misses by shaky Dak. Still, 3-0 and ate that clock."
939682385834131456,2017-12-10 02:25:13,"Lonzo had a big first quarter in full attack mode. Then Luke Walton rested him and ... I don't know what happened. He didn't like it? He lost his momentum, went back in his shell? Jordan Clarkson carried Lakers to a nice win in Charlotte with a big 4th quarter."

937152978946949120,2017-12-03 02:54:16,"I was wrong about Wis over OhioSt. Buckeyes just have too much firepower, too dominant in both lines. But this game has been so typically OhioSt: big plays, big mistakes. Should be much worse than 21-10."

937068657842077696,2017-12-02 21:19:12,My concerns about Baker Mayfield in the NFL: Just 6-1. Not sure his behavior can be trusted as a face of a franchise. Is playing behind college football's best O line. Arsenal of weapons. BUT EYE TEST TELLS ME HE'S A FIRST-ROUND PERFORMER.
937066979260641280,2017-12-02 21:12:32,"Not only is BakerMayfield most accurate passer in college football, but his arm has gotten stronger. Deadly deep &amp; underneath. Feet are so quick he constantly buys time while receivers uncover. Gunslinger who doesn't make many mistakes. Gamer. Baller. Will be hard to beat."
937064544723132416,2017-12-02 21:02:51,"Unless too many voters are alienated by his misbehavior, Baker Mayfield just won the Heisman. 41 TD passes to just 5 INTs for the season. 7 TD passes, 0 INTs in 2 blowouts of TCU, one of the country's best defenses. All-time great season. Congrats, Baker."
937015572063125504,2017-12-02 17:48:15,"Baker Mayfield, the bad boy of college football, is going to have to be a bad man if the Sooners are going to beat TCU's defense for a second time today. OU won't score 38 in the first half this time. This will be a battle."

936444531964182528,2017-12-01 03:59:09,What a drive. What a clutch third-down dart thrown by Dak to TWill.
936441200445239296,2017-12-01 03:45:55,That felt like the second half of the last three weeks. That was WAY TOO FAST AND TOO EASY. This could be trouble.
936439255647141890,2017-12-01 03:38:11,FINALLY: DEZ BRYANT DID WHAT HE USED TO DO SO SPECTACULARLY OFTEN.
936438697049784320,2017-12-01 03:35:58,"WITHOUT SEAN LEE, THE DALLAS DEFENSE JUST HELD AN OPPONENT TO ZERO POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER. But this could be a long 4th quarter. Cousins threw for 449 yards on this field last Thanksgiving."
936438005522247680,2017-12-01 03:33:13,Hark ... a DEZ SIGHTING.
936437732104060929,2017-12-01 03:32:08,"Hark ... an actual throw to BRICE BUTLER. More, more, more."
936437206780018690,2017-12-01 03:30:02,That was a nice throw and catch.
936436758606000128,2017-12-01 03:28:16,Dak's hand is obviously swelling. Just not sure he can grip and throw accurately. Last few passes have fluttered or wobbled. But as long as they can run for a couple of first downs and hang in on D ...
936431914092597248,2017-12-01 03:09:01,"Now NBC is saying it's a bone on top of Dak's hand, not his thumb. Maybe that won't be so bad."
936431479181021185,2017-12-01 03:07:17,"Without Sean Lee for five games this season, opponents have won the second halves 114-22 -- including 72-6 the last three weeks."
936431227350814720,2017-12-01 03:06:17,I'm guessing Dak's thumb is going to swell and tighten up in the second half and it will get harder for him to grip the ball and throw accurately. This could get shaky.
936426028502728704,2017-12-01 02:45:37,Look what Kirk Cousins closed his eyes and found.
936424312667377664,2017-12-01 02:38:48,They won't overturn this but they should.
936423193740324864,2017-12-01 02:34:21,I have been waiting for that ALL    YEAR    LONG.
936422067955572736,2017-12-01 02:29:53,Liked the last two play calls. Clever designs. But credit to the Redskins: They were ALL OVER BOTH PLAYS.
936418042128371718,2017-12-01 02:13:53,"That felt a little like the good old days. Dez, Cole Beasley, Jason Witten - touchdown. Remember that?"
936413727313707008,2017-12-01 01:56:44,Dak Prescott just needs one receiver to get open for one easy 15-yard completion to get his confidence back and get him going.
936411905668784128,2017-12-01 01:49:30,"That was actually a Cowboy-like interception. Good throw, right off Crowder's hands into Heath's. Cowboy fans have seen a few of those this year."
936410849941397504,2017-12-01 01:45:18,"Finally. Thank you, Kirk."
936410549415378946,2017-12-01 01:44:07,"REMEMBER: Every Cowboys receiver is having a worse year than last year. ColeB had 58 catches at this point last year - now 28 vs double coverage. Dez is a broken-down liability. On that last sack, NOBODY COULD GET OPEN."
936408261510578177,2017-12-01 01:35:01,Throw it on first down. Why not? Anyone know whatever happened to Brice Butler?
936407622219063297,2017-12-01 01:32:29,The only way the Cowboys win this game is if they somehow force at least two turnovers.
936407184006463490,2017-12-01 01:30:44,"Here goes Kirk Cousins, rolling toward an early TD."
936406970449272832,2017-12-01 01:29:54,"THIS IS SO WRONG. TWO BLAH RUNS AND AN OBVIOUS PASSING DOWN ... TO DEZ, WHO SHOULD'VE CAUGHT IT. JUIST MADNESS. SO PREDICTABLY BAD."

936344873816301568,2017-11-30 21:23:09,"Another nice round by Tiger at his little invitational on the course he owns and loves in the Bahamas. Led this field in birdies last year, then his body betrayed him again. Hard to trust it will hold up after so many injuries and surgeries."
936331135142977536,2017-11-30 20:28:33,"With Sean Lee in the lineup, the Cowboys are 18-4 over the last 2 seasons. Without him healthy, 0-5. Without him, opponents have won the 2nd halves 114-22. But that's all Dak's fault."
936329226470354944,2017-11-30 20:20:58,"It's still Nov and Lonzo just turned 20. He has 2 triple-doubles, 5 double-doubles, 5 games of making at least three 3s, back-to-back rebounding games of 16 and 13, NBA's 8th best assist-to-turnover ratio. But I'm told HE'S ALSO A BUST. Outrageously absurd. LaVar hate."
936328229916250112,2017-11-30 20:17:00,"For 16 games last year and the first 8 games this year, Dak wasn't just good, he was GREAT. Now, I'm told, he has been exposed as a bust. No trustable receiver, line decimated, NFL-worst D ... and he's a BUST??? Straight Cowboy hate. Laughable."
936327239485943808,2017-11-30 20:13:04,"Since Julio came into the league, Antonio Brown has led NFL in catches, yards, catches for first downs and yards after catch. Julio LOOKS the part, but AB PLAYS the part. Mentally tougher, more clutch. PLAYS bigger."
936326536524730368,2017-11-30 20:10:17,"How is it ""pathetic"" the Giants want to take a look at Davis Webb after Eli has missed the playoffs 5 of last 6 years, scored under 20 last 6 games last year (including playoff game), was 1-and-done in 4 of 6 playoff years and led NFL in INTs three times?"

935711587398139905,2017-11-29 03:26:41,"LeBron James in the Most Interesting Man in the World. Every game, drama swirls around him."
935707790978322433,2017-11-29 03:11:36,"Ref who threw out LeBron is Kane Fitzgerald, in his 9th NBA season out of New Jersey, where he started reffing at age 18. Now Fitzgerald has gone down in history as the first ref to eject LeBron in his 15-year career. Very possibly could wind up being the only to do so."
935706370250125312,2017-11-29 03:05:57,Just watched LeBron's postgame. I agree he too often gets fouled in paint w/o getting calls. Deserves more. He said he's used same language to a ref w/o getting tossed. Surprised he was so quickly w/ bang-bang techs. But obviously said the magic word.
935694265337856000,2017-11-29 02:17:51,"In recent games, LeBron missed a walk-off shot at home vs Clips - a running LEFT-handed shot, obviously shying from the FT line. And he missed a clinching 3 vs Charlotte at home, giving Hornets two chances to win. THOSE are clutch 4th-quarter points, not just empty calories."
935693330414895104,2017-11-29 02:14:08,"LeBron leads the NBA in 4th quarter points, as he has twice before in his career. Of course, he now plays high 4th q minutes whether the Cavs are way ahead or way behind. Many of those points have little or no impact and just serve to stuff the stat sheet."
935692098736500737,2017-11-29 02:09:15,Just got distracted for a second by a phone call. LEBRON GOT THROWN OUT FOR THE 1ST TIME IN HIS CAREER FOR USING FOUL LANGUAGE COMPLAINING ABOUT A CALL??? IN THE 4TH Q OF A BLOWOUT WIN??? WHY WOULD HE EVEN CARE AT THAT POINT??? STAT-PADDING???

934870692448759808,2017-11-26 19:45:16,Tom Brady continues to play at a higher level under more difficult circumstances than Carson Wentz. But there's no way Brady wins MVP. Too much jealousy and resentment. He's too great for his own good. He's already won too much even though he deserves to win again.

934080898231758848,2017-11-24 15:26:55,Eric Dickerson joins us now on @undisputed to talk about how much the Cowboys miss Zeke. We're on today only until 11 AM ET making way for college football.
934063025421672448,2017-11-24 14:15:53,Also today: What did Jerry's locker room speech mean? How big a Super Bowl threat are the Vikings? Bigger mess: mutinous Raiders or Elway's Broncos? Will Auburn upset Alabama? @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1
934062281914163201,2017-11-24 14:12:56,Shannon Sharpe and I are about to do battle over just how much the Cowboys miss Zeke. @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1
933853613264273408,2017-11-24 00:23:46,I am about to go live on Facebook to spill early knee-jerk opinions on this nightmare. JOIN ME.
933849160897331200,2017-11-24 00:06:04,"No doubt some Cowboy fans are glancing up at the CBS booth and thinking (or yelling), ""Come back, Tony!"""
933847484857593857,2017-11-23 23:59:25,"Dak finally got too desperate, just tried to make a play. Will mar what actually has been a pretty good game."
933847055654457344,2017-11-23 23:57:42,"Dez has to come down with that. His ball, even though Casey Hayward from Vanderbilt University just might be the NFL's best cornerback."
933845930666631168,2017-11-23 23:53:14,Defense is either gassed or has lost heart and is giving up. Or both. Just sorry. NO. SEAN. LEE.
933843726111186944,2017-11-23 23:44:28,That was Dak's first bad throw of the game.
933842014218502145,2017-11-23 23:37:40,"Without Sean Lee, the Cowboys have now been outscored in second halves 102-16 ... with a quarter to go of hiding your eyes."
933839890873073664,2017-11-23 23:29:14,I have to be honest: This game and this season are almost certainly over.
933839544792760320,2017-11-23 23:27:52,What a great throw and catch.
933839013374443520,2017-11-23 23:25:45,"This is just nightmarish. JUST ONE TURNOVER, PLEASE."
933837935496937472,2017-11-23 23:21:28,"Now I'm not sure a tiring defense can stop Rivers. He's getting hotter and hotter, feeling real good about what he's seeing."
933837646597570561,2017-11-23 23:20:19,The crushing part of the Ty Smith hold: It wasn't necessary. Dak would've escaped anyway. Easily could be 9-7. That's the kind of play that happens to a snakebitten team on a losing streak.
933836393737895936,2017-11-23 23:15:20,Dez has to catch that.
933835784217432064,2017-11-23 23:12:55,Now Dak has to face the NFL's best pass rush. Good luck.
933835543619690496,2017-11-23 23:11:58,"ZERO PASS RUSH. IF THEY KEEP LETTING RIVERS STAND BACK THERE WHILE DECIDING WHETHER HE'LL HAVE TWO OR THREE PIECES OF PUMPKIN PIE, HE WILL FEAST ON THIS SECONDARY."
933833404214210561,2017-11-23 23:03:28,Only hope: turnovers and sacks.
933832134732607488,2017-11-23 22:58:25,"Now the Cowboys are without the best guard in the NFL, Zack Martin. Once again, I'm wondering if this season just isn't meant to be."
933831106930941952,2017-11-23 22:54:20,This is the third straight game I've been disappointed in the Cowboys' pass rush.
933830680030539776,2017-11-23 22:52:38,"Dez: 14 targets vs Eagles. Zero in today's first half. If you're not going to throw to him, if he's now a broken-down liability, then PLAY BRICE BUTLER. He's just as big and much faster. Good things always happen when the ball is thrown his way."
933829365355261952,2017-11-23 22:47:25,"Reminder: This is the 5th game without Sean Lee, the driving force of the defense. 3 times they've led at half, twice they've trailed by only 3. Combined 2nd half scores of previous 4 games: Opponents 89, Cowboys 16. OBVIOUSLY THAT MUST CHANGE NOW."
933828609411727360,2017-11-23 22:44:24,Should be 9-0. Only 3-0. Like the way Dak began to operate going no huddle. Want to see more of that. I like the Cowboys' chances in this game far more than I did vs Philly last Sunday night.
933822374641770496,2017-11-23 22:19:38,"Jordan Lewis HAS to catch that interception, sun or no sun. Would've been a turning point."
933820782999781376,2017-11-23 22:13:18,Dak is losing confidence. No longer stepping into throws with conviction as did in first 26 starts. BUT I HAVEN'T YET SEEN AN OPEN RECEIVER ON ANY REPLAY. RECEIVERS JUST CAN'T SEPARATE. AT LEAST DAK ISN'T FORCING DANGEROUS THROWS.
933817045078106112,2017-11-23 21:58:27,Only hope for Cowboys D: FORCE A TURNOVER. now.
933803919184035841,2017-11-23 21:06:18,"3 weeks ago Shannon Sharpe started saying Case Keenum is ""just a backup."" I kept saying, no, I like him,  he's a pretty good starter. He just completely outplayed Matthew Stafford in Detroit on the Thanksgiving stage and won AGAIN."
933802083366576128,2017-11-23 20:59:00,"I will go live on Facebook as soon as this game is decided to give my final thoughts on the ""death match"" between the Cowboys and Chargers. JOIN ME SOON."
933540485922091008,2017-11-23 03:39:30,Never thought I'd say this: But OKC has been blowing leads because Russ has been too unselfish. Not tonight. The new Big 3 has to turn back into the Big 1 down the stretch.
933539064266997763,2017-11-23 03:33:51,"It sure looked like, when KD and Russ started jawing nose to nose, KD called him something that Russ definitely is not. Then Russ responded on the scoreboard."
933537566661345280,2017-11-23 03:27:54,FINALLY: Russ and the great fans in a great city got some revenge over Kevin Durant. This wasn't about Melo or Paul George. It was about RUSS SHOWING AND TELLING KD.
933533989712773120,2017-11-23 03:13:42,I'll say it one last time: The Cowboys should've signed Revis before the season. They needed his veteran Hall of Fame presence in their kindergarten of a secondary. Now KC has him.
933520037293338625,2017-11-23 02:18:15,Awesome 4th quarter by LeBron ... against the Nets.
933424205109927936,2017-11-22 19:57:27,"Shannon Sharpe picked Chargers 31-20. So I proposed he give me Cowboys plus 10. NO! But he said he'd give me 10 if I give him Steelers +10 at home vs NE on Dec. 17. When I accepted, he reneged. TOO SCARED OF DAK."
933423424365400064,2017-11-22 19:54:21,No doubt Dak Prescott is one interception away from fans chanting for Romo to come down out of the CBS booth tomorrow at JerryWorld. BUT IN DAK I TRUST. HE WILL BOUNCE BACK BIG VS CHARGERS.
933422964891992065,2017-11-22 19:52:31,No Undisputed tomorrow. But don't forget the best NFL pregame shows are on Fox starting at 10:30 eastern time. HAPPY THANKSGIVING. We're back Friday to debate Cowboys-Chargers.

933180711628021761,2017-11-22 03:49:53,Hate to say it but right now Lonzo is an all-time shooting slump. Shot 41% from 3 at UCLA! Opened tonight's game with an airball 3 that didn't even come close. Has crumbled under dad-fueled pressure.

932976706570219520,2017-11-21 14:19:15,Pro Football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe and I are about to go at it over Pete Carroll's decision to run that fake field goal. @undisputed. 9:30 AM ET. FS1
932840137456627712,2017-11-21 05:16:34,I believe Russell Wilson would have kicked the 52-yard field goal that Blair Witch Project missed short. Russell is that incredible in 4th quarters.
932839672228622336,2017-11-21 05:14:43,I can't blame Pete Carroll for trying to break a fake field goal for a touchdown with 7 seconds left in the half. Obviously he feared Matt Ryan would hang 40 on his decimated D. He needed go-for-broke touchdowns not FGs.
932823296080461824,2017-11-21 04:09:39,"Kyrie, MVP so far. Man was a MAGICIAN at Dallas tonight. 47 points, 10 in OT. 16-22. 5-7 from 3. 10-11 FTs. Nothing like him. You watch, Bron?"
932802074286342144,2017-11-21 02:45:19,Russell Wilson should've run that same rollout play at the goal line against the Patriots at the end of that Super Bowl. Better than a pop pass or a Marshawn run.
932794183739260928,2017-11-21 02:13:58,"Silly me. I thought the 11-5 Pistons would battle back, force LeBron to keep scoring for the short-handed Cavs. Nope. Pistons said, ""No mas,"" in the 2nd quarter, trailed 73-46 at half. LeBron took rest of night off. Next!"
932787233219780609,2017-11-21 01:46:21,The sky-and-snatch catch Julio just made between two Seahawks -- Dez used to make that catch regularly. Not anymore. So frustrating.
932771440318758912,2017-11-21 00:43:36,"LEBRON ALERT: Cavs are short-handed at hot Detroit. Less pressure than usual on LeBron, expectations lower, and he has come out firing with a hot hand. 16 in the first quarter. Could go for 50+."
932721886760284161,2017-11-20 21:26:41,"At least OU did SOMETHING to punish Baker Mayfield, even if it's just a little wrist slap. Will the shame change him for the better? Hope so. Doubt it."
932720658215141376,2017-11-20 21:21:48,"Highly amusing that Dak Prescott had his first bad game in 27 starts, dating to the first game of his rookie year, and now the Cowboy haters are yelling, ""See! He was a fraud all alomg!"" 26 straight starts of fool's gold? That's foolish."
932718168463745024,2017-11-20 21:11:55,"THINK ABOUT THIS: In the 4 games without Sean Lee, the Cowboys led 3 times at halftime and trailed by only 3 at Atlanta. Yet in the 4 second halves, the Cowboys were outscored 89-16! They fall apart without their leader and driving force."
932717275244675072,2017-11-20 21:08:22,"They wanted me to hurt this morning on Undisputed. But I let go of this Cowboys' season last week. No Sean Lee, no hope. No Tyron Smith, no way. Not meant to be. Waiting till next year."

932474243559800832,2017-11-20 05:02:38,I am going to unleash tomorrow at 9:30 E on FoxSports1. SEE YOU THEN.
932473146866724869,2017-11-20 04:58:17,"Nice triple-double by Lonzo Ball including SIXTEEN REBOUNDS - more than twice as many as any other player on either team. Hey, Luke Walton, look what happens when you let him play 40 minutes!"
932465360434995200,2017-11-20 04:27:20,That was by far the worst game of Dak's career so far. More live on Facebook soon. JOIN ME.
932458108776955904,2017-11-20 03:58:32,If only Dak's receivers could make catches like the Eagles just keep making.
932452917121974272,2017-11-20 03:37:54,"As I said last week, congratulations, Eagles, you won the NFC East. The injury and suspension gods decreed it: Fly, Eagles, fly. This year should've belonged to Dallas. But now it's Philly's. Ring that Liberty Bell. Schedule that parade."
932452177729150977,2017-11-20 03:34:57,That's it. Game over. Defense hung in as long as it could.
932451479872348160,2017-11-20 03:32:11,That long run does not happen if Sean Lee were in there.
932450667200778240,2017-11-20 03:28:57,"Trust me, the Cowboys miss Tyron Smith as much as a run-blocker as a pass-protector."
932450357682118656,2017-11-20 03:27:44,"Only way the Cowboys win is if Philly makes a big mistake, or two."
932448973826138113,2017-11-20 03:22:14,As easy and scary as the first Eagles drive- except for the gutsy trickery on 3rd and 1. CAN ANYONE TRY TO TACKLE THE TWO-POINT PLAY???
932444015584198657,2017-11-20 03:02:31,"If Anthony Brown could've caught that easy interception with his feet under him, it would be 12-7 ... if not 16-7. It has just been one of those years."
932443262593335296,2017-11-20 02:59:32,I said it would be close at half but still don't love Cowboys' chances of hanging on without Sean Lee. Head over heart.
932437583153438720,2017-11-20 02:36:58,Interception was just a desperate bad idea by Dak. Why keep forcing it to Dez Bryant??? Just don't get it.
932435237828624385,2017-11-20 02:27:39,"Would've been a tough catch, but you-know-who HAS TO MAKE THAT CATCH."
932433377604407296,2017-11-20 02:20:15,WHY WOULD YOU RUN ROD SMITH A SECOND STRAIGHT TIME ON 2ND-AND-6? LET DAK MAKE A PLAY!
932431268007985152,2017-11-20 02:11:52,TWill still should've hung onto that tipped pass. But ... it has been that kind of year.
932429426456895488,2017-11-20 02:04:33,"That was borderline pass interference on Darby, but Dez isn't getting those calls the way he used to."
932428443878166528,2017-11-20 02:00:39,"Eagles blitzing like mad. Dak went to his ""hot"" read - Dez on the fade. He just wasn't open. Darby ran the route better than Dez did. Need a new ""hot."""
932427495911055360,2017-11-20 01:56:53,"More read option, less Dez. Once, he would've made Darby look silly one on one in the flat."
932425665978163200,2017-11-20 01:49:37,"Just to be clear, with Sean Lee, Tyron Smith and Ezekiel Elliott, the Cowboys would've beaten the Eagles convincingly tonight."
932425176557355008,2017-11-20 01:47:40,"At this rate, this will get even uglier than I feared."
932424654429360128,2017-11-20 01:45:35,No way would the Eagles be running the ball down Dallas' throat if Sean Lee were healthy. He'd be blowing up most of those plays. Without him: mismatch.
932423780734865409,2017-11-20 01:42:07,What was THAT call reversal???
932423161102008321,2017-11-20 01:39:39,Cowboys starting two rookies and a 2nd-year player in the secondary ... with no Sean Lee. Hide your eyes.
932422050571960320,2017-11-20 01:35:15,"Good throw on third down, better defense. Yet once upon a time, Dez shielded the defender and snagged that pass for a big first down."
932421085198290944,2017-11-20 01:31:24,"I have so little faith in the Cowboys' chances I'm actually eating dinner as I watch. Usually there's no way I could eat during a Cowboy game. Too locked in, keyed up."
932411143666122752,2017-11-20 00:51:54,"I am about to go live on Facebook to aim a little trash talk of 2 NFL Hall of Famers I know, then talk Cowboys-Eagles. JOIN ME."
932406782370004992,2017-11-20 00:34:34,The AFC West I thought would be the AFC Best has turned into the AFC Worst. Right now the West doesn't deserve to have a single playoff team.
932406102838329345,2017-11-20 00:31:52,"Is there any doubt the Patriots are the NFL's best team and that Tom Brady is the MVP so far? He won't win it - too much resentment/jealousy. But vs Raiders: 30-37 for 339, 3 TDs, 0 INTs. For season: 22 TDs to just 2 INTs. Pretty great. And he's only 40!"
932362345732456448,2017-11-19 21:38:00,"So Kirk Cousins: He throws for 323, 3 TDs, no INTs but blows winning field goal position with intentional grounding and sack. Saints complete epic comeback in OT. Can't trust Cousins. Lacks winning intangibles. PLEASE SIGN HIM, WASHINGTON."
932355960361820161,2017-11-19 21:12:37,"Wonder what Hall of Famers Shannon Sharpe and Eric Dickerson will say on tomorrow's Undisputed about picking Rams over ""backup"" Case Keenum. I took Keenum, who played very well. Vikings, 24-7, despite two missed FGs. Hmmm."
932338419329482752,2017-11-19 20:02:55,UNBELIEVABLE: ANOTHER KICKER GOES SOUTH. NOW FORBATH IS COSTING THE VIKINGS A CRUCIAL HOME GAME WITH HIS SECOND MISS. SUCH A TERRIBLE PART OF FOOTBALL.
932311146735865856,2017-11-19 18:14:33,"Maybe the Rambassador, Eric Dickerson, is right about what he's been saying on Undisputed. Maybe the Rams ARE a legit threat to win the NFC. Opening 7-0 TD drive at Minnesota. Highly impressive."
932028824375590912,2017-11-18 23:32:42,Baker Mayfield has some Manziel in him. Johnny fell prey to alcohol/drugs. Here's hoping Mayfield can turn the rebel in him into a strength instead of his downfall.
932027756451213312,2017-11-18 23:28:28,"Kansas capts started it by refusing to shake Baker Mayfield's hand after coin toss. KU player cheapshotted him. BUT HE CAN'T RESPOND WITH THE SIDELINE GESTURE HE USED. IT'S JUST KANSAS, BAKER. Just keep throwing TD passes."

931374964556492801,2017-11-17 04:14:30,"Somewhere Eli is grinning. He threw the luckiest pass in Super Bowl history, caught by Tyree against his face mask ... similar to the pass Antonio Brown just caught against his helmet."

931368772677419008,2017-11-17 03:49:54,Both the Celts and Warriors played suffocating defense. But in the end Kyrie was able to do what LeBron always shies away from - get to the free-throw line. Kyrie isn't afraid to make late crucial FTs.
931368062669938688,2017-11-17 03:47:04,I said on Undisputed that the Celtics are legit enough on defense to hold Golden St under 100 (check) and to cover the 7-point spread (check). But I said the Warriors would win 99-94. Wrong.
931367370056130560,2017-11-17 03:44:19,What a statement Kyrie's New Team just made to LeBron's Old Team and to the rest of the NBA. These Celtics are LEGIT.
931353297415421952,2017-11-17 02:48:24,The mask didn't bother Kyrie the other night but he just took it off. Trying to distribute too much when his team needs him to get more aggressive and SCORE.
931345545578274816,2017-11-17 02:17:36,Kyrie is going to HAVE TO score more than 5 points in the 2nd half if the Celts are going to hang in. They were 4 of 19 from 3 and they just can't score. Kept shooting their crowd out of the game.
931295486014656512,2017-11-16 22:58:41,"The worst thing Luke Walton can do to Lonzo Ball right now is to NOT play him, especially in the 4th quarter. Luke wants to win at any cost, even if it means sitting Zo while he's in a shooting slump. HE'LL WORK HIS WAY THROUGH THIS IF HE IS ALLOWED TO. SPECIAL TALENT."

931008095811125248,2017-11-16 03:56:41,"Watching the Sixers right now, it's hard to believe they're only 7-6. This is a budding juggernaut. Even Robert Covington, who just got a big new deal, is becoming a star."
931005065476718592,2017-11-16 03:44:39,I did like the way the Cavs played defense in the second half. DWade helped set the tone. Progress. Sign of life.
931003827133624320,2017-11-16 03:39:44,"LeBron had a nice game ... but started toying with MJ's team late, missed last 4 show-off shots, nearly let 'em back in it. Still, LeBron called it a ""huge win"" vs Charlotte that has lost 5 straight. ARTHUR FIST!"
930970188165537792,2017-11-16 01:26:04,"Whether he's gone for 4 games or 6, what's the difference really for Zeke in what's becoming a lost season for the Cowboys. Now, I just hope he puts this time away from football to good use."
930967968405524481,2017-11-16 01:17:14,Zeke probably deserved to be suspended for several other incidents. Yet it appears there was no conclusive proof he was guilty of domestic violence. NFL just needed to show it's DOING SOMETHING about an issue it had often bungled. So it made an unfair example of a breakout star.
930965157907390464,2017-11-16 01:06:04,"ONCE MORE: 2 police depts investigated accusations vs Zeke, did not charge him. NFL's director of investigations, Kia Roberts, was the only NFL staffer to interview accuser (6 times), recommended no suspension. Texas judge ruled unfair appeals hearing. YET 6-GAME SUSPENSION."
930963658238070785,2017-11-16 01:00:07,"No surprise Zeke finally gave up, as Brady did. Beaten down by hundreds of hours spent on legal process. At least he fought long enough to win back some of his unfairly tainted reputation."

930295691355742208,2017-11-14 04:45:51,I doubt Miami would've won anyway but whatever chance the Dolphins had was blown by Jay Cutler's inexplicably bad interception late in the first half as Miami trailed only 10-7. As always he made some good throws and one team-crusher.
930284511119548417,2017-11-14 04:01:25,"If Sean Lee hadn't pulled his hamstring late in Sunday's first quarter, the Cowboys would've beaten the Falcons and they would beat the Eagles."
930273188465950721,2017-11-14 03:16:26,"Cavs saved LeBron with 3-point salvo in the fourth quarter, led by Kyle Korver, aided by 3 late missed free throws by Porzingis. Cavs scored 13 in 2nd q, 23 in 3rd, 43 in 4th - came from 23 down to win. Knicks gagged."
930270613414932480,2017-11-14 03:06:12,"LeBron just missed 2 clinching late free throws, giving the Knicks one last chance to tie, but he LeBricked the 2nd so badly it bounded right back to him. Offensive rebound. Game over. Great miss."
930250013367660544,2017-11-14 01:44:21,"In the first half the Knicks made LeBron eat his words. Knicks by 13. LeBron, 5 turnovers. Ntilikina, 5 steals. But long way to go."
930242219361026048,2017-11-14 01:13:22,GOOD FOR ENES KANTER GETTING IN LEBRON'S FACE AFTER IT LOOKED LIKE LEBRON AND NTILIKINA GOT INTO IT (FUELED NO DOUBT BY LEBRON'S SAYING KNICKS SHOULD'VE TAKEN DENNIS SMITH JR.)
930240802080436224,2017-11-14 01:07:44,"Please explain how Alfred Morris went nowhere in the first half then suddenly gashed Atl for 20, 14 and 11 setting up (unfortunately) the missed FG. Alfred obviously isn't Zeke but HE'S PRETTY GOOD. 1st half was just so weird."
930239560520384513,2017-11-14 01:02:48,"What I can't get over is that Chaz Green started TWICE for Tyron Smith last year WITHOUT ALLOWING A SACK. Yes, it was ""just"" Chi and SF. But Adrian Clayborn HASN'T EVEN BEEN A STARTER FOR ATL. Had just 2 sacks. Now he has 8. It was like Chaz forgot how to play."
930238735953797120,2017-11-14 00:59:32,"No player is more important to a defense than Sean Lee is to the Cowboys' D. He covers, plugs, blitzes. He reads offenses pre-snap the way Brady does defenses. He is the signal-caller, the leader, the driving force. Without him a young defense loses cohesion and heart."

929922943680888832,2017-11-13 04:04:41,"The Cowboys lost at Denver 42-17. The Patriots are leading at Denver 41-16 with 9 minutes left. Yet as I said the day after 42-17, the Broncos just played their Super Bowl. Now, the Patriots are on their way to yet another Super Bowl."
929920972051816448,2017-11-13 03:56:51,"Such outrageous uncalled pass interference on Chris Harris Jr. But he had just been called for a 50-50 penalty, so refs let it go. Just wrong."
929907028192931840,2017-11-13 03:01:27,"At 40, Tom Brady is STILL the best QB in the NFL, no matter who his receivers are or if he's playing in Denver, his personal house of horrors."
929897644809269248,2017-11-13 02:24:09,That was a catch and TD by Gronk.
929894003855695872,2017-11-13 02:09:41,"Of course, it's possible Martellus was shutting it down on Green Bay after Aaron Rodgers was lost yet he's turning it back on for a Tom Brady who has always defended and praised him."
929893496030298112,2017-11-13 02:07:40,"Classic Belichick: Packers waive Martellus saying he didn't disclose a shoulder injury, 31 teams pass on him, yet not only does Belichick take him, HE'S PLAYING MATELLUS TONIGHT AND HE'S CATCHING PASSES. In your face, Green Bay."
929889748700631040,2017-11-13 01:52:47,Dion Lewis ran that kickoff back for a 103-yard touchdown as much with his head as his speed. So smart. So shifty. So New England.

929859115593097216,2017-11-12 23:51:03,Chaz Green's name will go down in Cowboy infamy the way (for longtime Cowboy fans) the name Phil Pozderac once did for infamous holding calls late in a 17-14 loss to the eventual Super Bowl champion Giants.
929857626560544768,2017-11-12 23:45:08,"This is just a joke. Chaz Green even with help can't even TOUCH Adrian Clayborn. He just takes off like a sprinter at Dak. On your mark, get set, SACK."
929855822720413701,2017-11-12 23:37:58,The Cowboys defense always loses cohesion and ultimately heart without its quarterback and driving force Sean Lee.

929849462494609408,2017-11-12 23:12:42,Only hope is a turnover.
929848215867858944,2017-11-12 23:07:45,Jaylon Smith went the wrong way on Coleman run. Sean Lee wouldn't have. Going to be long second half.
929844312812032000,2017-11-12 22:52:14,Should be 10-10 but I fear it's going to be a long second half for Dak Prescott without any run game or much pass protection.
929841784556945408,2017-11-12 22:42:11,Bad call on Heath set that up. Two uncalled penalties on the first Dallas drive cost the Cowboys at least a field goal. That kind of day.
929838899597160448,2017-11-12 22:30:43,Terrible call on Heath.

929825678005899264,2017-11-12 21:38:11,"As I said on Undisputed, I was more worried about losing Tyron Smith than losing Zeke."
929825352779685888,2017-11-12 21:36:54,Chaz Green obviously can't handle blindside pass protection. But the first sack was AN OBVIOUS FACEMASK. Wouldve set up a field goal. Shaky start.

928760675580575744,2017-11-09 23:06:15,Obviously the Cowboys won't be quite as good without Zeke BUT THEY WILL HAVE DAK PRESCOTT and a defense that is starting to grow up and lock in. So the Eagles shouldn't plan their parade just yet.
928759332665094144,2017-11-09 23:00:55,I have no idea how the court system of this country has allowed the NFL to enforce a domestic violence suspension on Ezekiel Elliott without conclusive proof UNTIL HIS APPEAL CAN BE HEARD ON DEC. 1.

927753677749682177,2017-11-07 04:24:48,"I said before the draft I wasn't a big fan of Brett Hundley, and I'm still not."

927314009593745408,2017-11-05 23:17:43,Now we see what the Cowboys are made of.
927313903926763521,2017-11-05 23:17:18,Chiefs go from what they're calling the Hill Mary to a sack race TD by Kelce and the lead. Feeling real good about selves. Front-running.
927307976603348993,2017-11-05 22:53:44,"Agree with Jason Garrett: Cowboys played surprisingly stingy D in 1st half. Should've held the explosive Chiefs to 3. Now, LOCK BACK DOWN."
927307637439397888,2017-11-05 22:52:23,"Now it's momentum, KC. Chiefs get it again to start the second half."
927307422628175872,2017-11-05 22:51:32,"Great play design. Lousy passive defense, awaiting a Hail Mary, not ready to actually have to go tackle the fastest guy on the field."
927306355974610944,2017-11-05 22:47:18,"Dak Prescott doesn't get enough credit for a lot of things, but especially for the key-play damage he does with his legs. So underrated."
927306004210970624,2017-11-05 22:45:54,"Thank you, Dak Prescott. Huge play. 14-3."
927302457092276225,2017-11-05 22:31:48,"Not another sun ball. That was a pretty easy catch for Dez, right where he likes it. That's 2 catches that would've led to pts, not caught."

927263447531655168,2017-11-05 19:56:48,AJ Green is no overemotional overreactor. That wasn't knee-jerk anger. He'd had enough of Jalen Ramsey. Accepted ejection for retaliation.
927261459167375361,2017-11-05 19:48:54,"Wentz, Eagles look sensational, albeit vs Osweiler. But heaps even more pressure on Cowboys to hang in by beating KC. Another gotta-win."

926965437740359680,2017-11-05 00:12:37,WRONG REPLAY CALL: Interception began happening BEFORE helmet-to-helmet hit. Ref 1st said targeting happened AFTER. INT should've stood.
926955891693203457,2017-11-04 23:34:41,"In the Okla-OklaSt game, there are a whole lot of receivers, running backs, O linemen and 2 QBs who are going to play in the NFL."
926940148268277760,2017-11-04 22:32:07,"Told Ernestine before the game Okla would beat OklaSt 50-48. Uh, make that 80-78. 38-all at half on FoxSports1. OU: America's best offense."

926627688516796417,2017-11-04 01:50:31,Weird to see LeBron with such a hot hand shoot two late air balls on jumpers.

926548876470841344,2017-11-03 20:37:21,Goodell obviously needs to put a high-profile face on his new zero-tolerance domestic violence policy - ZEKE'S. W or w/o credible evidence.
926547234384101376,2017-11-03 20:30:49,"Kia Roberts, the only member of Goodell's staff who interviewed Zeke's accuser, recommended no suspension for Zeke. Talked to her 6 times."
926546726764265472,2017-11-03 20:28:48,"2 police depts found Zeke's accuser not to be credible. Kia Roberts, former DA now NFL's director of investigations, found her not credible."
926546207844974592,2017-11-03 20:26:45,No court should allow Goodell to convict Zeke Elliott of domestic violence w/o credible testimony even though CBA gives him absolute power.
926545031422345216,2017-11-03 20:22:04,I said from the start Zeke has a strong case vs Goodell. Still think he has a decent shot of winning in Appeals court. SHOULD KEEP FIGHTING.

924858323773431809,2017-10-30 04:39:42,Seems like hours ago that Clayton Kershaw had a 4-0 then a 7-4 lead. Never seen such clutch slugging in a World Series. Pitching optional.
924784514659786752,2017-10-29 23:46:24,The Dallas Cowboys are going to win the NFC East.
924784368693809152,2017-10-29 23:45:49,I said before the draft that every team needing a QB that passed Deshaun would regret it. 402 yds passing in toughest place for rookie QB!
924784051558293504,2017-10-29 23:44:34,I said Friday I thought Deshawn could score 24 at Seattle and that Hou would cover 5.5 spread. Shannon/Mangini/Rob scoffed. How bout 41-38?!

924735529249259520,2017-10-29 20:31:45,Nice hold by the defense. Nice kick by a Dallas-bred kid in his 2nd NFL game.

924412809722523648,2017-10-28 23:09:23,Why with JTBarrett on fire throwing (16 straight completiions) would you call two straight runs going for 2? 2 failures could cost the game.
924396595658895361,2017-10-28 22:04:57,Ohio State's Denzel Ward SHOULD HAVE easily intercepted that overthrown pass.
924396364598874114,2017-10-28 22:04:02,Gutsy correct replay overturn. PSt rec DID control catch going to ground. Would've held on cleanly. But ball ripped out after hit ground.
924139995144716288,2017-10-28 05:05:19,"Again disappointed in Lonzo. Went passive, quit attacking, again let big lead slip away, got pulled. Seems uncomfortable shooting at Staples"

922226966039691264,2017-10-22 22:23:37,This is huge for the Cowboy D as the weather and schedule turn cold: contagiously forcing turnovers. Another great sign.
922225994978623488,2017-10-22 22:19:45,I don't love Jeff Heath at safety and I definitely do not love him as the backup kicker.
922225541733683200,2017-10-22 22:17:57,Dak Prescott is such a clutch and underrated runner. Key runs on key plays.

917170109231243264,2017-10-08 23:29:28,The Cowboys are simply not good enough on defense playing a bunch of rookies in the secondary against Aaron Rodgers.
917167743450746880,2017-10-08 23:20:04,I've been calling for that ... but it came too early.

917165519924453376,2017-10-08 23:11:14,That's a first down. Caught the ball past the marker.

917163008077447168,2017-10-08 23:01:15,CHEAP CALL.
917161960734572544,2017-10-08 22:57:06,UNBELIEVABLE. PACKERS GIVE THE COWBOYS 15 YARDS. COWBOYS GIVE IT RIGHT BACK ON THE KICKOFF WITH A HOLD. BAD-TEAM PENALTY.

917154127162990592,2017-10-08 22:25:58,Packers already have 112 yards rushing ... to the Cowboys' shockingly low 61.
917152357984567296,2017-10-08 22:18:56,I would've thrown that flag. Rodgers was defenseless. Just unnecessary.
917152056741216256,2017-10-08 22:17:44,Dumb killer penalty.
917151484625567744,2017-10-08 22:15:28,"To hang on, Cowboys D will have to force a turnover. Doubt they can. Not their style."

917137789535137792,2017-10-08 21:21:03,FYI: This game is far from over. Dak has had the ball 18 minutes to ARodg's 6 minutes.
917136626077261825,2017-10-08 21:16:25,"No sarcasm intended here ... very seriously, very sorry to hear about Odell's broken leg. I like him very much personally. He's had tough yr"

917133122419924992,2017-10-08 21:02:30,The best news: Cole Beasley is back catching two TD passes.
917132727379357696,2017-10-08 21:00:56,"Cowboys offense is now Dak escaping, making huge down-field plays on the run. Sensational to watch. Not sure you can depend on it long term."
917131183728738304,2017-10-08 20:54:48,It just amazes me how often Cowboys O line gets whipped and sometimes how slow Zeke is out of the blocks. Definitely isn't last season.
917129927543087104,2017-10-08 20:49:48,"Hark, a catch by Dez. Usually looks as if he's throwing DOWN the X as the ball arrives."
917129110945619969,2017-10-08 20:46:34,"If Aaron Rodgers has the ball enough today, he will throw for 400 yards and five touchdowns."

917127314097319936,2017-10-08 20:39:25,Pack without Ty Montgomery. But much bigger loss: Cowboys without Sean Lee. Big trouble vs ARodg.
917126806498459649,2017-10-08 20:37:24,"Dak once again was superb on that drive. Zeke and O line, not so much."
917126511429160960,2017-10-08 20:36:14,"Awful call vs Green Bay after YET ANOTHER BUTTER-FINGERS DROP BY DEZ. Hey, he was owed SOMETHING after that playoff robbery at Lambeau."
917124876128854016,2017-10-08 20:29:44,"As I keep saying, every time he's given opportunities, BRICE BUTLER just keeps making big plays. Not 88. 19."
917124046600364032,2017-10-08 20:26:26,"Pack wins toss, defers, dares struggling Dak Attack. Time to respond."
917121585781260288,2017-10-08 20:16:40,Odell can get melodramatic when he's hurt - this time he's crying uncontrollably - but it DID look like leg got caught &amp; wrecked his ankle.
917120382397640705,2017-10-08 20:11:53,The Jags are - and SHOULD BE - much improved on D. But the Steelers are a troubled team swirling around AB and LB.

916750538124886016,2017-10-07 19:42:15,I wonder how much longer Bob Stoops' brother Mike will last as holdover D coordinator? OU D has struggled all yr. Gave up 38 at home to ISt.
916749447308107777,2017-10-07 19:37:55,Bob Stoops often lost Big Games badly. But he almost always won the little ones. Lincoln Riley won a Huge Game at OhSt. Lost to IOWA STATE.
916748681516163072,2017-10-07 19:34:52,Iowa St just beat OU at OU starting a senior QB who had never started and using the former starter at linebacker. So embarrassing.
916748177272737792,2017-10-07 19:32:52,"Pretty sure this loss will cost Baker Mayfield the Heisman. 2nd half, receivers just couldn't get open. He didn't panic/force. Just got beat"

916385150988034048,2017-10-06 19:30:20,I'm NOT encouraged by Pats' win. D got torched in 4th q and line couldn't protect Brady from NFL's weakest pass rush. Bad signs.
916384455060742144,2017-10-06 19:27:34,"Even if they lose Sunday, the Cowboys will remain 1-0 in the NFC E and they will STILL WIN THE DIVISION, which is all that really matters."

916147688730529792,2017-10-06 03:46:44,"Tom Brady was again the GOAT tonite. Pats can't protect him. He's mostly throwing to 2 undrafted guys, Amendola/Hogan. 30 of 40 for 303."

914588269618319361,2017-10-01 20:30:10,I said before the draft that Deshaun Watson was easily the best player in the draft.

914581052324057088,2017-10-01 20:01:29,That was the one to intercept. Anthony Brown just missed it.

914572005940256768,2017-10-01 19:25:32,"Again, if the Cowboys don't intercept Jared Goff or create one turnover, they will lose."
914571744081580032,2017-10-01 19:24:30,WHY TRY TO FORCE TO A DEZ WHO CAN'T GET OPEN ON ANYBODY???
914571268954800128,2017-10-01 19:22:37,Now we're back to Zeke going nowhere on first down. Just a killer for a drive.
914571106513698816,2017-10-01 19:21:58,The Dez drop is looming as the key blunder so far in the second half.
914570915412938753,2017-10-01 19:21:12,Now the Cowboys can't stop the Rams and the Rams are starting to stop the Cowboys. I don't feel good about this game right now.

914566634555236356,2017-10-01 19:04:12,Defense must create one turnover. Just one.
914566148011712512,2017-10-01 19:02:16,Defense is really starting to miss Sean Lee.
914564817603641344,2017-10-01 18:56:58,ANOTHER BIG DROP BY DEZ BRYANT. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS MAN???
914564162419855361,2017-10-01 18:54:22,Dez just looks SO SLOW.
914563839517114368,2017-10-01 18:53:05,Surprised Switzer hasn't been benched. That was the punt he needed to retreat and field.
914563398318387200,2017-10-01 18:51:20,DLawrence finally made a play and Crawford couldn't find the loose football.
914560276854398976,2017-10-01 18:38:56,Best first-half stat: Cowboys controlled ball and clock for 18 minutes to Rams' 12. KEEP RAMS OFFENSE OFF FIELD VS D WITHOUT SEAN LEE.
914559749055766530,2017-10-01 18:36:50,Cowboys will have to intercept Jared Goff at least once to hold off the Rams in the second half. So far very little pass rush on him.
914557361720762368,2017-10-01 18:27:21,"Hey, Aaron Rodgers: Dak Prescott is gaining on you when it comes to QBs making plays with legs and arm."
914556861772308480,2017-10-01 18:25:22,That's a touchdown off another great escape by Dak.
914554988982095873,2017-10-01 18:17:55,Dak Prescott: strength and poise.
914553278641397761,2017-10-01 18:11:07,Rams robbed.
914553005013430277,2017-10-01 18:10:02,"Touchdown, Rams. Clear control. Thank you, Ryan Switzer."
914552179607982080,2017-10-01 18:06:45,Ryan Switzer is a terrific returner who fumbled WAY TOO MANY PUNTS AT NORTH CAROLINA. CAN'T GO HIGH-RISK HIGH-REWARD IN THE NFL. KILLER.
914550354116624384,2017-10-01 17:59:30,"No team is deeper at running back than Dallas. Alfred Morris is such a nifty threat. McFadden can get you 100. Run, Cowboys, run."
914545281944903680,2017-10-01 17:39:21,JUST SO BAD. CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN AGAINST THIS TEAM.
914544742905638912,2017-10-01 17:37:12,What a great athletic will-not-be-denied play by Ezekiel Elliott.
914542704687669249,2017-10-01 17:29:06,Great effort by Zeke.
914540627848826881,2017-10-01 17:20:51,"Ryan Switzer has guts but on first 2 kickoffs, dumb guts."
914540472537714688,2017-10-01 17:20:14,"No Sean Lee. No Nolan Carroll. No Woozy. No Hitchens. Will be long hard day for D. But early ""win"" on 3rd-7. 3-all. Drive, O, drive."
914538276903620608,2017-10-01 17:11:31,"How much fresher will Rams be off 10 days off vs Cowboys off road Monday-nighter? Lombardi: ""Fatigue makes cowards of us all."" Here we go."
914537812459872256,2017-10-01 17:09:40,Second-down no gain off read option killed opening drive. Dak should've kept. Not a great start vs NFL's No. 1 scoring offense.
914537092897583105,2017-10-01 17:06:48,Best Zeke run of the year.
914536704421384192,2017-10-01 17:05:16,Dez does the Michael Irvin after catching big first-play pass. Good start for him and team. Be like Mike.
914210781247311872,2017-09-30 19:30:10,"Proud of my school Vandy for scoring 24, hanging in at Fla. But so disappointed in late-game tackling. HAD A CHANCE. HIT WITH YOUR HEART."
914010810111844352,2017-09-30 06:15:33,Very close call on whether Darnold was trying to throw when he lost game-ending fumble. BUT NO COMPLAINT FROM HIM OR HELTON. NO REVIEW???
913926850698555392,2017-09-30 00:41:55,"Hey, Zeke: prove you haven't lost confidence or a step or gained a few pounds. Your D needs you to keep ball away from NFL's No. 1 O, LA's."
913925760355676162,2017-09-30 00:37:35,"Congrats on your new deal, Russ. You earned it. Now prove you can sacrifice some of your stats for more W's - and a deep run."

912523693095391232,2017-09-26 03:46:16,HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
912523171403665409,2017-09-26 03:44:12,Just one turnover.
912522967057174528,2017-09-26 03:43:23,Hanging on for dear life.
912520206714408960,2017-09-26 03:32:25,You HAVE TO let Dak throw for that clock-killing first downl
912518049126768640,2017-09-26 03:23:51,"Finally: Eat, Zeke, eat."
912515239811223552,2017-09-26 03:12:41,Need a turnover.
912514360899018752,2017-09-26 03:09:11,That happened RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE COWBOYS BENCH. WHAT A DUMB CHALLENGE.
912514142468059136,2017-09-26 03:08:19,Why challenge that? Garrett just pulled an Arians.
912513859419652097,2017-09-26 03:07:12,"Scandrick, BROKEN HAND. Healthy, he intercepts that."
912511279239069696,2017-09-26 02:56:57,"What a throw on the run by DAK PRESCOTT, to the underutilized deep threat Brice Butler, who is underrated big &amp; fast."
912509989469564930,2017-09-26 02:51:49,Linehan's fault. Slow on the draw. Play/personnel in late. Hope that lost time out doesn't come back to haunt.
912509441227890688,2017-09-26 02:49:39,Just hope Dallas D can hold up. It has been on the field far longer than Arizona's.
912505796830752769,2017-09-26 02:35:10,Scandrick couldn't play that ball in the air because of his broken hand.
912504724674326528,2017-09-26 02:30:54,That series got blown up when Zeke went nowhere on first down.
912502976761126912,2017-09-26 02:23:57,"Jeff Heath, another big loss in the secondary. Here we go again."
912501074514255872,2017-09-26 02:16:24,"The Cowboys have scored two touchdowns tonight, both on pure guts."
912500744044941312,2017-09-26 02:15:05,"THROW UP THAT X, DEZ BRYANT. YOU EARNED EVERY INCH OF THAT. THAT'S HOW YOU LEAD AND INSPIRE YOUR FOOTBALL TEAM."
912497721625288704,2017-09-26 02:03:04,"This is hard to watch. Cowboys' vaunted O line can't win, Zeke going nowhere slowly."
912493578282086400,2017-09-26 01:46:37,The Cowboys played an overall poor half and it's 7-7. Could've been so much worse.
912492296368668672,2017-09-26 01:41:31,"I wouldn't recommend that move routinely for Dak, BUT THIS OFFENSE NEEDED A PLAY MADE &amp; HE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO GO FOR THE HIGH-RISK TD."
912489396393226240,2017-09-26 01:29:59,"Zeke just doesn't look right. Even on the missed-tackle breakaway run, he just didn't have the usual acceleration."
912489090175574016,2017-09-26 01:28:46,So far Arizona's sneaky-talented defense has been much better than the Cowboys' stuck-in-mud offense.
912486247767064576,2017-09-26 01:17:29,Throw it to Cole Beasley.
912484542350475264,2017-09-26 01:10:42,"Now the OFFENSE looks overmatched. Line can't run block. Zeke looks like he's lost confidence, running in mud, no burst. Huh?"
912483024075292672,2017-09-26 01:04:40,This is becoming a second straight disaster. From holding the Giants to 3 to can't stop anybody.
912481835992604673,2017-09-26 00:59:57,"Great. Scandrick gone, again. TROUBLE."
912481303454351360,2017-09-26 00:57:50,You are KIDDING. Saw nobody off sides.
912481046146424832,2017-09-26 00:56:49,Now I don't love stopping this 4th-down play.
912480252760174592,2017-09-26 00:53:39,"Game on the line right here. Somebody on the Cowboy D must make one momentum-shifting play, now."
912477038900011008,2017-09-26 00:40:53,"Just a shockingly bad start. Carson Palmer just shredded the pass defense, boom-boom-boom. That time, ABrown and Heath got burned."
912474187981234178,2017-09-26 00:29:34,"That was actually big of Jerry Jones, taking a knee on the field, even though it was just before the Anthem. Hey, it's SOMEthing, a start."
912472605914939393,2017-09-26 00:23:16,I'm just not sure who can play cornerback tonight for the Cowboys. Carson Palmer isn't THAT old or bad.
912472413220233216,2017-09-26 00:22:30,"I believe the embarrassment in Den was just what the Cowboys needed early this season. They weren't ready to play. Tonite, they'd better be."
912472008192954368,2017-09-26 00:20:54,This feels a little like at Wash Game 2 last yr. Crucial bounce-back. But last yearr no 42-17 happened. I'll admit I'm a little nervous.

912100905201188864,2017-09-24 23:46:16,"I know what it feels like to lose on a late FG by Mason Crossbar, except the ones that beat me were luckiest ever, from 55 and 51 yards."
912100639466860544,2017-09-24 23:45:13,"Aaron Rodgers does it again, tricks 'em into offside, D out of sync, off balance, hits big pass to set up OT win. If can't beat em trick em."
912099951949225984,2017-09-24 23:42:29,Packers win.
912098657306009600,2017-09-24 23:37:20,Shannon Sharpe's pick to win the SBowl -- Seattle -- now teetering at 1-2. He will hear about this tomorrow 930-noon E on FS1. UNDISPUTED!
912097001843462144,2017-09-24 23:30:45,Bengals would've won this game at ARodg if they hadn't missed an easy field goal.
912067218355007488,2017-09-24 21:32:24,Terrible block-in-back call erasing Titans punt return TD vs Seahawks. Refs serving as 12th Man on the road.
912064775072264192,2017-09-24 21:22:42,"I must've just imagined that Aaron Rodgers, greatest thrower of football ever (according to Shannon Sharpe) just threw a Pick Six."
912064322880249856,2017-09-24 21:20:54,"Richard Sherman, cheapshot late helmet-to-helmet hit on Mariota out of bounds, hears about it from Titans. Offsetting penalties??? Wrong."
912061695484239872,2017-09-24 21:10:28,"JJWatt has now played 6 games vs Belichick who compares him w Lawrence Taylor. In those 6, Watt has half a sack. None today. Overhyped."
912060880929529856,2017-09-24 21:07:13,"Most incredible about Brady's day: Pats struggled to protect him w/o best blocker Marcus Cannon. STILL: 5 TD passes, 0 INTs, almost 400 yds."
912059081342435329,2017-09-24 21:00:04,"What's w the Bears at home? Should've beaten Atl, did beat Pitt (with 220 yards rushing). Fell behind 29-0 at Bucs who lost at Case Keenum."
912054296211894272,2017-09-24 20:41:04,I picked Lions&gt;Falcons AND THEY GOT ROBBED. Because refs got TD call wrong (not sure about that) it cost Lions 10-sec runoff and final play?
912052241300779009,2017-09-24 20:32:54,Wonder if they'll throw a parade in downtown Philly tomorrow for the Eagles?
912051999155220480,2017-09-24 20:31:56,"What a missile of a game-winning 61-yard kick by the Eagles rookie kicker. Giants have to feel little better about selves, but still 0-3."
912050534751756288,2017-09-24 20:26:07,"I said after draft, if O'Brien will just hand him the reins and stay out of way, Deshaun will do for Houston what rookie Dak did for Dallas."
912049988766547968,2017-09-24 20:23:57,"Deshaun gets burned by the boob O'Brien not signaling for a time out, blowing a shot at 2 more plays. Deshaun STILL almost pulled it out."
912048178085617664,2017-09-24 20:16:45,Tom Brady strikes again. Still the clutchest QB ever at age 40. TD pass and 2-pt pass with :23 left.
912046997321814016,2017-09-24 20:12:03,PASS INTERFERENCE ON BRADY'S DEEP THROW TO BRANDIN COOKS.
912043647096336384,2017-09-24 19:58:45,"Incredibly, a 14-0 Eagles game thru 3 quarters has turned into a Big 12 shootout in Philly. Both teams are flawed."
912039771706232832,2017-09-24 19:43:21,I'll say it again: Deshaun Watson should've been the 1st pick in the draft. He has the Texans in position to beat Tom Brady in Foxboro.
912038720169058304,2017-09-24 19:39:10,"Now Odell does what he does best, makes a nice catch to tie the game and avoids a celebration penalty. Way to go, OBJ."
912037196755984384,2017-09-24 19:33:07,Odell continues his look-at-me act on the sidelines until McAdoo finally has to ask him to stop. 1st good thing Much-ado has done all year.
912036532390830080,2017-09-24 19:30:28,Odell finally catches a TD pass then makes like a dog marking his territory. 15-yd penalty. He again promotes himself at expense of his team
911716315764744192,2017-09-23 22:18:03,"OK, Bama, we challenge you to best 2 out of 3. Next you play my Vandy Commodores in basketball, then baseball. Good luck to you. Troll Tide."
911704822780280832,2017-09-23 21:32:23,All you need to know about my Vandy team is it got a delay penalty ON THE 1ST PLAY OF THE GAME. Step slow all half. 31-0 Bama at half.
911704120754503680,2017-09-23 21:29:35,"I tried to tell Shannon Sharpe that Bama is way better than my school, Vandy. Asked for only 21 pts for case of Dew. Nope, scared of Vandy."
911675442741919749,2017-09-23 19:35:38,"Once I would've scoffed at idea of my hometown of OKC having an NBA team. Now thanks to Sam Presti it has had KD, JHarden, RW, Melo and PG."
911650849021075456,2017-09-23 17:57:54,Russ has always been slightly more interested in starring than winning. He got his Season Triple Double. Now can he sacrifice for his title?
911649859706380288,2017-09-23 17:53:58,So many Russ assists came off 2-on-1 drives that ended up w dumping ball to bigs or occasional kickouts. Melo/PGeorge as spot-up shooters?
911648616363601920,2017-09-23 17:49:02,Melo and PGeorge know only offense revolving around them. Now they're playing w a PG who shattered NBA record for Time With Ball in Hands.
911647568316076033,2017-09-23 17:44:52,"Now in OKC, Melo and Paul George will have to commit to developing a new part of their games: Standing and watching without pouting."
