932432281641390085,2017-11-20 02:15:54,You’ve gotta be kidding me. Elliott - a Damn practice squad player - misses gimme FG after interception. Eagles come away with nothing! Damn! Damn! Damn!
932431313268887552,2017-11-20 02:12:03,Int not on Dak. That was about Bell —- Dallas’ latest experiment at left tackle — getting beat and Dak having to rush pass. Ball tipped too. Don’t matter. Garrett and Linehan have to resolve that. Question is: Are they capable
932424641443979264,2017-11-20 01:45:32,Yeah! Yeah! Eagles = Touchdown.
932421434693095424,2017-11-20 01:32:48,Daaaaammmmmmnnnit! @Eagles give up 61-Yards on opening kickoff. Come on! Damn!
932413710232154117,2017-11-20 01:02:06,"Btw.......I know Osweiler and Burfict are friends. Wasn’t speaking to Burfict’s intent. Just that folks who may not know they’re friends may have looked at it differently, because of how little Osweiler is thought of"
932405593591070720,2017-11-20 00:29:51,"4-and-out! No doubt adding insult to the loss, Vontaze Burfict goes over and hugs Osweiler after he flops, as if to say: “Thank You Brock....for being YOU.”Damn!!!"
932404923865731073,2017-11-20 00:27:11,"H Lord. Brock Osweiler has the ball, needing to go 80 yards for a @Broncos win or about 45 to 50 yards for a tying FG. Why is it that I have ZERO faith in him?"
932390436261519361,2017-11-19 23:29:37,Perhaps someone can explain to me how the @Patriots are suppose to have this awful defense — although it’s improved — and yet @derekcarrqb and the @RAIDERS can’t score a single damn point? What has happened to these guys?
932386797107273728,2017-11-19 23:15:09,What a disastrous day for the the @buffalobills. Petermen’s FIVE interceptions and subsequent benching leaves McDermott with an awful lot of explaining to do. The @RAIDERS disastrous tendencies need to be addressed to
932371040239521793,2017-11-19 22:12:33,"My bad. Petersen has FOUR — Yes, 4 — interceptions for the Bills. I know he’s just a rookie, but if you’re going to bench Tyrod Taylor, it doesn’t need to be for someone who’s doing things we haven’t seen done since 2002."
932369061765353477,2017-11-19 22:04:41,"The @buffalobills’ rookie QB — who Tyrod Taylor was benched for — has thrown 3 Int’s in his first 9 passes, all in the First Quarter. Experiment/Risk by McDermott isn’t looking go good right now"
932366244564660224,2017-11-19 21:53:29,"Osweiler just flung a football into middle of the field w/looking. Lucky it wasn’t intercepted. Dude is so lucky. I see certain guys in this league QBing, and it just makes me think more about @Kaepernick7. @KingJames knows he’s blackballed like rest of us."

932360669357379585,2017-11-19 21:31:20,"Ingram is running all over the @Redskins right now. They’re either worn out or simply can’t stop him. Gruden looks lost on the sidelines. Understood. @Saints just won the game. As great as Cousins was, couldn’t stop bleeding when it counted."
932359097894174721,2017-11-19 21:25:05,"@Giants beat @Chiefs in OT. Alex Smith and that offense was awful today. And in case y’all are missing this, @buffalobills bench Tyrod for a 5th-Round Rookie (Petersen), who’s already thrown 2 INT’s. Looking bad for them right now."
932357917709426688,2017-11-19 21:20:24,"Intentional grounding by Kirk Cousins. WTH! Cost @Redskins 10 yards and 10. Stupid mistake by Cousins, who’s been otherwise great today. We’re going to OT, y’all"

932356612026765315,2017-11-19 21:15:13,The GREAT Drew Brees is 11-for-11 on last two drives after @Saints trailed 31-16 with under 5 min left. Now they’ve scored on 2-pt conversion. Game tied 31-31. Let’s see what @Redskins do now.
932356144420589570,2017-11-19 21:13:21,Although @Saints just scored another TD and pulled within 31-29. Now they need the 2-pt conversion
932355982533054464,2017-11-19 21:12:43,"As for the @Redskins I figured they’d show up today and play. Nobody’s thinking about them, so there’s no pressure. They wait for expectations to actually wet the bed and disappoint you."
932355518567473152,2017-11-19 21:10:52,"Not surprised at all the @Vikings beat the @RamsNFL either. Their defense is big time. @RamsNFL offense? I needed to see them against a defense like this to believe. Came in w/ questions about Rams &amp; left w/ them, too."
932354973769326592,2017-11-19 21:08:42,Watching the end of this @ChicagoBears vs @Lions game. Snap? Perfect! Hold? Perfect! Kick by Connor Barth? Beyond atrocious. Waaaaay wife right. Wasted damn-good closing drive by Trubisky. So sad how kickers can ruin a game.

925021462481768448,2017-10-30 15:27:57,I’m about to respond to Mr. J.R. Smith on @FirstTake right now!!!!!
924998133075103745,2017-10-30 13:55:15,"Haven’t heard much of an opportunity this weekend to discuss McNair’s comment, player reaction and J.R. I do now😀😀😀! @FirstTake on ESPN. NOW"
924873661143764993,2017-10-30 05:40:38,"Bad loss for @Dodgers. All they seem to have is Jansen and the @astros don’t fear him. Now, Verlander is 9 innings away from title. Not good"
924865313686114304,2017-10-30 05:07:28,Whew!
924865004503031809,2017-10-30 05:06:14,"Every time Altuve swings hard at first pitch and misses, he usually ends up smacking home run. I have that feeling now"
924864237058560000,2017-10-30 05:03:11,"Even if Jansen stops them in 9th, there’s the 10th, considering the way this game has gone"
924864051829772289,2017-10-30 05:02:27,Tie Game. Taylor single up middle. Guess that means HOUSTON wins at bottom of inning because @Dodgers have no pitching left. They’re spent!
924861967432667136,2017-10-30 04:54:10,Are you kidding me? Now Puig hits a HR with one hand. 2-run shot. It’s now 12-11. I can’t! I just can’t!
924854467597684736,2017-10-30 04:24:22,"Man, Baseball is out the window. Strategy! Mechanics! Gone! This is all about heart &amp; guts. Simple &amp; plain"
924853452290908160,2017-10-30 04:20:20,"Amateur play by Pederson there. What the hell are you watching for. RUN....FORREST....RUN. Would’ve easily had triple, possibly inside HR"
924848365061459968,2017-10-30 04:00:07,"And now Correa. This is unreal. I know Marrow should’ve been taken out. He needs a day. But w/ @astros, would it really make a difference?"
924847886147481600,2017-10-30 03:58:13,"I don’t mind saying this to anyone: Watching Altuve throughout these playoffs, I haven’t felt this excited since watching Barry Bonds!"
924846841425989633,2017-10-30 03:54:04,Springer turns around and shows massive heart with a solo blast at the bottom of the inning with a 480-Ft homer. Lord have mercy.#Crazy
924846626300145664,2017-10-30 03:53:13,"I’m done. This WS is just ridiculous. Insane. After Springer makes an EGO mistake instead of staying in front of the ball, losing the lead,"
924840442503553024,2017-10-30 03:28:38,Why the hell are the @steelers throwing the football right then on 2nd down and stopping the clock? I swear I wonder about Haley sometimes.
924839969369264128,2017-10-30 03:26:46,Yeeaaaahhhhh!!! @steelers defense holds — in Red Zone again. Now all Big Ben has to do is get 1st Down. Give it to me fellas! Bring it home
924779049720872961,2017-10-29 23:24:41,"Major props to @HoustonTexans though. Fought valiantly. And I like O’Brien but man, you’ve got to take chances. Watson is special. Roll Dice"
924778490976784384,2017-10-29 23:22:28,BTW......it’s amazing how @HoustonTexans did is practically non-existent without J.J. Watt in lineup. Totally different defense
924778118874910722,2017-10-29 23:20:59,"Great drive by @Seahawks. If @HoustonTexans lose, this in on O’Brien or the O-coordinator. Keep the ball in Watson’s hands &amp; likely win."
924777355129901057,2017-10-29 23:17:57,"BTW.....major props to @DeAndreHopkins. After all this noise, he showed up and BALLED. Did his JOB. That’s what I wanted to see.#Respect"
924777006708994048,2017-10-29 23:16:34,Damnit Bill O’Brien. Why so damn conservative? Put the ball in Watson’s hands. Let him make the call to run or throw.
924776167181340672,2017-10-29 23:13:14,As for Kirk Cousins and the @Redskins they just are what they are: good enough to be interesting/compelling. But simply don’t win enough.
924775912201162752,2017-10-29 23:12:13,"DeShaun Watson is just special.@ChicagoBears should be sick for passing on him, as well as the @nyjets. Legion of Boom no more????#Hmmm"
924766327163760640,2017-10-29 22:34:08,Damn good point on Doctson by Troy Aikman. Absolutely has to make that catch for the @Redskins. Right thru his arms. @dallascowboys luck up.
924712523559067648,2017-10-29 19:00:20,"I love my football, but my Sunday’s just aren’t the same knowing that baaaaadddd man @AaronRodgers12 isn’t playing. Get well soon, Brother!"
924415390737985536,2017-10-28 23:19:38,"Fashion in which they lost may have just cost @PennStateFball a shot at the National Title. Personally, I’d like an 8-Team playoffs not 4"
924414126545428480,2017-10-28 23:14:37,You have Barkley @PennStateFball. McSorley wasn’t getting time to throw anyways. Give it to the man &amp; sink or swim

924412968498028544,2017-10-28 23:10:01,Terrible kick off by @OhioStateFB. Why the hell are you kicking a squibbler? @PennStateFball has excellent field position. Just need a FG
924412653719695360,2017-10-28 23:08:46,Big-time passes by J.T. Barrett to take take lead. Didn’t get 2-pt conversion. Only concern: 1:48 left. Lots of time for @PennStateFball
924411683438759938,2017-10-28 23:04:54,Tremendous comeback by @OhioStateFB. But there’s still 3:07 to go in game. Can J.T. Barrett get it done for them? In a Big Game? Let’s see
924401482958606342,2017-10-28 22:24:22,And btw.....I shouldn’t even get on NIKE b/c A.) Don’t even know if they designed it and B.) the hoodie could look fly in other instances.
